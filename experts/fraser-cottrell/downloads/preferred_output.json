It is basically a pacing tool for marathons, like the London Marathon that are in big cities that lose GPS. I have absolutely no idea the logistics of it or why it happens. So the GPS at certain points of a marathon kind of like taps out. It just interrupts your flow. So basically when you wear this thing, your GPS on your watch is linked to this. I'm going to be wearing this on Sunday because I know the London Marathon is pretty notorious for losing signal at certain points of the race. So how you use it. I have a Chorus watch. You sync this to your watch, clip it to your shoe, and then you run. All of the data just comes through your watch how you would usually use it, which is pretty cool. I've been testing it out on every single run that I've done this week. It works really, really well at the places that I normally lose signal, sometimes in areas where there's loads of high-rise buildings or going under tunnels. I've had perfect and consistent GPS throughout, which has been great. And it even worked on my hallway. This is the Chorus Pod 2. I will be using it on Sunday. I'm going to be so, so dialed in with my paces.

When it comes to odor control, we have two choices. We have the deodorant and antiperspirant aisle for armpits, and then we have the mortification lane that's feminine hygiene. Nobody thinks anything of talking about deodorant for armpits. And what makes Lumi different is that we check that box in a really big way, but we do so much more than that. And we're able to do that because of our unique formula that every other company said no to, by the way, when I pitched it to them 15 years ago. And now it's catching on like wildfire. We put Lumi to the test. 12 hours after a shower with soap alone, the average armpit had an odor score of eight out of 10. We tested Lumi on some very challenging armpits. And our armpits are the stinkiest part on the human body. 12 hours after a shower with soap and applying Lumi, those odor scores were zero, no odor. So I'm here to debunk the hygiene industry. And Lumi's here to right the wrong because all body odor is the same no matter where it happens on your body. So you never have to walk down the mortification lane. You never have to think about just selectively using a deodorant in your armpits and soap everywhere else. Lumi has done the work for you and it's clinically proven to work better than a shower with soap, even if you shower twice a day.

She told me that it would happen every time she would shave, and she shaved, like, every two to three days because she had a boyfriend, and she wanted it to be smooth. It would get extremely red and super bumpy all the time. But the problem was that there were no natural solutions on the market. And trust me, we looked everywhere. We went to drugstores, department stores, pharmacies. We talked to doctors, gynecologists, estheticians. And none of them was able to give us a clear answer. So what we did was that we created our own solution. Basically, it's a five-step natural skincare routine that is going to replace your razor and prevent razor bumps and ingrowns from happening again in the future. Let me show you. It starts with Bye Bye Bouche. This is a natural hair removal cream. Keep It Clean is a cleanser that you apply every time you shower. Then we have Ingrowns Out. This is all you need. It has witch hazel, which helps a lot with ingrown hairs. Then you have the final touch. So this is a moisturizing oil. It makes my skin and my hair super soft. And this is the last one. This is a complement to Bye Bye Bouche. We launched this routine three years ago, and the feedback has been amazing. Every week, we receive awesome reviews from women saying that they love the products, they love that it's all natural, and that it works. I had no idea that one day, one of my biggest insecurities would turn into this. Anyway, I keep whispering because my roommates just left. Anyways, if you have weird skin, just ignore this. But in case you struggle, I did this routine for you. You can click the link if you want to check it out. Kisses. I need to go now.", "d4a1abae4f3eb8eef7079e333831a153.mp4": "This smells good on everyone because it smells different on everyone. It smells like you, just a little better.

So what ended up selling me fully on the mask is that they do a 45-day money-back guarantee. To me that kind of showed that they put a lot of trust in their product and that if I felt like it wasn't working for me or not worth the investment I could just send it back. The fact that this face mask is also 10 minutes and it's hands-free, rechargeable, you can see out of it while you're using it so you can watch your show, journal, cook, do whatever. I feel like anyone who has acne or has had acne can relate that you're always kind of searching for like a magic product, one that will stop acne forming, heal your scars, skin texture, everything and I honestly feel like this LED mask from Omnilux is it for me.", "fc542193bb9b1853a99e99e7a34fedf7.mp4": "Three reasons my kids think I'm mom of the year.

Louise used to suffer regular and extremely painful breakouts of eczema on her head, arms, and neck. Her mom tried everything her dermatologist prescribed, as well as anything she could get across the counter that could possibly help. The biggest problem was the itching and stopping her child from causing more damage to her skin, a problem which a lot of parents with eczema can relate to. This is the same story as Cassia, who suffered from really bad psoriasis on her legs. She had given up hope of finding a solution to the angry red rashes. Same story as Ashley, who, like Louise, suffered from large breakouts of eczema, mainly all over her shoulder and neck area. It affected her movement, as well as the ability to work and perform basic tasks such as washing her hands without pain and terrible flaking. Each of these stories ends with the discovery of Harlan M.D.'s Smart Lotion Eczema Cream. And this is the result of just a few weeks of use. It's simply incredible. Smart Lotion worked on Louise, Cassia, and Ashley because it actually tackled the root causes of their dermatitis, instead of just relieving symptoms. Louise's mom was a little worried about the low-strength hydrocortisone that is one of the main ingredients of Smart Lotion. But luckily, Smart Lotion's second main ingredient is element sulfur, which isn't just a prebiotic that prevents flare-ups. It also shields the skin from any reactions that may come from the low-strength steroid. Cassia's life was changed by Smart Lotion. She now only uses it occasionally for maintenance as recommended. If you know anybody who suffers from eczema symptoms or any other type of dermatitis, I highly recommend that they look into getting their hands on some Smart Lotion.

Mistake number one, not addressing diet. Alcohol and inflammatory foods can wreak havoc on your skin. Make sure to plan your meals according to your skin's needs. Mistake number two, too many prescription steroids. These drugs are great for the initial control of thick, severe flare-ups. But when used beyond two weeks, they can actually make eczema worse. Anyone who suffers from SWS will tell you that it's not a fun experience at all. So always weigh up your options before making this step. And number three, perhaps the biggest mistake, not addressing the root causes of eczema. That's why I recommend Smart Lotion from Harlan MD, as it provides complete healing to the two root causes of eczema, which are inflammation and imbalance in the skin's microbiome. Smart Lotion provides prebiotics for microbiome balance, healing polymers for skin barrier repair, and a safe anti-inflammatory to stop painful rashes. This cream is also an FDA-approved anti-itch cream, so it'll also provide relief for that pain as well. When used daily, Smart Lotion provides a 95% success rate for clear, eczema-free skin.

I know what you're thinking, a few years ago I'd have thought the same, what is this guy talking about? Watch this video and find out.\nIch bin Stephanos. Ich bin Glyn und wir sind die Gr\u00fcnder von Schaktimat. Leider sprechen wir kein Deutsch.\nAber wir wollen euch gerne Schaktimat pr\u00e4sentieren. Also schalten wir jetzt auf Englisch um. Together we were backpacking through India, Cambodia, Nepal, Thailand for four years and on the way we discovered the Schaktimat. And the first time I used the Schaktimat I was completely fascinated by it. Of course it prickles in the beginning but after a while you get this amazing feeling of relaxation. The pressure of the spikes on the skin releases endorphins and oxytocin into the body. These are also known as the happiness hormones. So after some minutes of laying on the mat you start to really kick back and feel relaxed. And of course the Schaktimat does much more than that. The fine tips increase the blood circulation and that enables to release stubborn tensions in the body. And also we've had thousands of our customers writing back to us telling us how the Schaktimat has helped them a lot with their back pain issues. You can read everything that they're saying on our website. Since the day we started with Schaktimat it has been especially important to us to make the product as ethical and sustainable as possible. The Schaktimat is 100% handmade in our female only factory in Varanasi, India where we only employ women. And this is so that we can support them to become self-sufficient and financially independent. And with each Schaktimat you don't only bring relaxation and pain relief in your life, you also contribute to our social impact, especially around female empowerment in India. So get your Schaktimat now and start experiencing the many benefits of acupressure. Sometimes some of our customers ask us if the Schaktimat is at all dangerous or if it hurts. To be clear the Schaktimat is not dangerous at all. Acupressure is an ancient healing technique that is thousands of years old and can bring many health benefits to the body. Even though it prickles a little bit in the beginning, after a while you start to see the benefits of the Schaktimat. And for people with more sensitive skins we have the Schaktimat Lite which you can use on more tender parts of your body like the chest or the belly. You can also begin by using the mat on a sofa or a bed or wearing a thin t-shirt to allow time for the body to adjust to using the Schaktimat on bare skin. So basically the Schaktimat is suitable for everybody. The Schaktimat relaxes over a quarter million people in Germany already and it has received over 7,000 five-star reviews so far. In fact we're so convinced that the Schaktimat can help you that you can test drive it for 60 days and if you're not completely satisfied you can return it. And to summarize, you take zero risk, you reap all the benefits of acupressure through the Schaktimat by bringing pain relief and relaxation into your life and at the same time you get to support our crafts women in India. So discover acupressure for yourself on Schaktimat.de. And cut. How do you think that went? I need to lay down on a Schaktimat.

Why is AG1 more expensive than other greens powders on the market? So this is us, we're Athletic Greens, and we sell AG1. We source the highest quality ingredients from all over the world and concentrated extracts and forms that the body can easily recognize and use efficiently. Because we want our product to actually work and provide results. Another factor that plays in the cost of AG1 is that it's NSF certified for sport. Which, if you don't know what that is, it's the highest standard of quality testing for dietary supplements. The ingredient dosages of AG1 are verified to be in every single batch. It's safe, it's free of harmful contaminants, and to add another layer, it's free of 270 plus banned substances in major athletic organizations. Lastly, and maybe the biggest reason, is that AG1 is more than a greens powder. I mean, honestly, we're comparing apples to oranges here. Greens powders alone do not cut it for achieving the full benefits that many see with AG1. Our formula is a comprehensive supplement that gives you 75 foundational nutrients that you need for optimal health, including adaptogens, prebiotics, probiotics, and more. Every scoop of AG1 is meant to replace nine supplements that you could be taking every day. Each serving contains all of these vitamins and minerals. Check out our website to see the full list.
