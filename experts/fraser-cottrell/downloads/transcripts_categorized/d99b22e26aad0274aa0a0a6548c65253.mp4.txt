}, Hey, I'm Dani and I'm from the Yukon. A lot of people ask me how do I deal with the mosquitoes in the north. They can be quite brutal at times, so let me show you my secret. Tonight I'm sleeping under just a tarp with no bug netting in the middle of the alpine where there's tons of mosquitoes. We brought along our thermocell, which is a scent-free mosquito repeller that gives you 12 hours of protection within a 15-foot radius. We were able to sleep peacefully without the bugs bothering us all night. So what's stopping you from coming to the north? Follow for more Yukon adventures.
