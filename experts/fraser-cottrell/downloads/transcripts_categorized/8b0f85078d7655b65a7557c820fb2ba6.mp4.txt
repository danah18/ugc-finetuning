}, I've been using the Omnilux Clear LED face mask for about three months now and it has completely reduced my acne as well as simplified my whole entire skincare routine. So what ended up selling me fully on the mask is that they do a 45-day money-back guarantee. To me that kind of showed that they put a lot of trust in their product and that if I felt like it wasn't working for me or not worth the investment I could just send it back. The fact that this face mask is also 10 minutes and it's hands-free, rechargeable, you can see out of it while you're using it so you can watch your show, journal, cook, do whatever. I feel like anyone who has acne or has had acne can relate that you're always kind of searching for like a magic product, one that will stop acne forming, heal your scars, skin texture, everything and I honestly feel like this LED mask from Omnilux is it for me.
