}, Soho, the chai I was getting at coffee shops is loaded with extra sugar and made with artificial flavors. It's a pale imitation of what chai should be. So I just stopped going because I found Kolkata chai. The signature masala mix is my new obsession. Every morning I make myself a spiced little drink that gives that nice gentle caffeine boost. A much better start than waiting in line at a Starbucks and buzzed out on sugar coffee by 9am. I boil it in a pot, add some almond milk, strain and sip. It's that easy and you can customize it to your liking. Imagine being hooked to something actually good for you so click the link below and grab a combo pack to save $14.
