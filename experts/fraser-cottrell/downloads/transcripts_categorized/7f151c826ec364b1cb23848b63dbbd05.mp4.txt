}, Three things dermatologists should be telling you about eczema treatment. Number one, the classic. Things like dairy, red meat, and seafood are all common culprits, so the best method is to eliminate foods in stages, depending on your reaction to them. Number two, high-powered steroid cream can actually make eczema worse. These creams are awesome in some situations, especially when combating major flare-ups, but when they are treated as the solution to everything, they can lead to horrific withdrawal symptoms. Treat these as a last resort in most cases. Number three, eczema has two root causes, inflammation and microbiome imbalance. This is why I recommend Smart Lotion from Harlan MD. It's been specifically developed to tackle both root causes of eczema at the same time. This makes it a must-have for anyone suffering from dermatitis. It doesn't just clear up eczema flare-ups, but it stops it from coming back or getting worse. That's my top tip. Order some Smart Lotion today.
