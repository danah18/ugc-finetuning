}, I loved Aloha's protein bars, so how about their drinks? Let's go! Okay, it tastes like milk, but like a bougie type of milk. I feel good already. Iced coffee. This is plant-based protein and it's healthy. It's only 170 calories. Just perfect. And now I'm gonna try the coconut. The coconut is my favorite just because I love everything coconut. And growing up in the Philippines, I ate a lot of coconut and drank a lot of coconut juice. I think this is my honey. It's gluten-free, it's dairy-free, soy-free, nothing artificial, no stevia. So it doesn't taste like medicine. You'll be able to recognize all the ingredients. There won't be any suspicious science-y additives in there. The chocolate sea salt. You know, sometimes I drink chocolate drinks and sometimes they're kind of salty and really, really sweet. But this one is just right. I can see these drinks being very useful, like when you're out and about and need a boost of protein without the guilt. You can actually taste the organic ingredients very clearly and the flavor is so good.
