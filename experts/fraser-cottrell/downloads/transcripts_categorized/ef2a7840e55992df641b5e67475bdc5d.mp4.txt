}, Everyone's wearing Linish and here's why. Of course it's an Irish brand, all of their jewellery is water resistant and their pieces are designed to take you from day to night. For me, jewellery is just essential to elevate your outfit. None of my outfits ever feel completed without my jewellery accessories. And as you can tell, I'm a gold girl instead of silver.
