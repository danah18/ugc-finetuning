}, You have five seconds. What is a wellness hack that everyone needs to know this year? Chai. That was quick. Chai? Why? So chai has amazing health benefits and it detoxifies your whole body. And I also love that it's different to coffee in the sense that it doesn't give you like an instant caffeine boost. It's slowly energizing you throughout the day so that you're not having a massive crash later on. So how do you make it? So I use Kolkata chai. What I like to do is I put some water on the stove, heat it up with the chai in it and get that boiling. And once that's done, I add in some milk after I've strained it. I like to just have my chai and my milk. That's my favorite. But you can spice it up however you want. So this is the wellness hack that you think that everyone should be doing this year? Yes, definitely. This will change your life. Trust me. Okay, well, I think I need to try this. So it's called Kolkata. Kolkata chai is what I use. Literally, it's the best chai I've ever had.
