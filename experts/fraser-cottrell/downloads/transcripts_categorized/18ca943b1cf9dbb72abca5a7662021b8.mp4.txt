}, It's day one of my period. These are actually leak proof underwear. Why not try them out with these white pants? I mean, they look and feel just like normal underwear, but they have this like high tech built-in protection. I still can't believe I'm not wearing a tampon. It kind of freaks me out. And then you just literally throw them in the wash.
