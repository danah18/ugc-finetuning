}, I just found this in the ocean and it transformed my holiday. It's called The Essence Vault. They're affordable, inspired by perfumes that are a fraction of the price. So I basically wanted to test it out. I used it on every day of this holiday and I'm not saying this lightly. It was insane. It lasted so long. I smelled so good. Even my girlfriend complimented me and she never does that. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to smell good without breaking the bank.
