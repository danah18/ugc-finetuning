  "product_description": "A mascara with a metal rod applicator instead of traditional bristles, designed to curl, lengthen, and hold lashes all day without smudging."
}, People keep asking me what falsies I'm wearing, and it's literally just this metal rod mascara doing everything. What's crazy is there's literally no bristles and it holds a curl. Now that we have it on, let me give it a few hours, let it set in, and we'll really put this curl to the test. So we're back after a long day of wear. I think it's been about six or seven hours now. Look at my lashes. My lashes look like I just did them. Let's just do a smudge test for fun. Nothing. There's literally nothing on my finger. If you're looking for a mascara that won't disappoint, this is it.
