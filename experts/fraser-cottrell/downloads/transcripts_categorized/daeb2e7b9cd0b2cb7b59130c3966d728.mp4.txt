It streamlines audio management for gamers, streamers, and content creators by letting users control outputs without leaving their current application and customize what their audience hears during streams."
}, Is audio really that important? When two separate audio tracks are too loud, it's a serious problem. The solution is the Beacon Mix Create, an audio mixer that allows you to separate up to eight different audio tracks. But why do I need my audio tracks to be separated? Let me break it down for you. Let's say you're grinding Valorant, but you have to have music on to get excited and focused for your game. But you're also in Discord with the boys. But you also need lineups, so you have to have a YouTube video open while you're playing. That's four different audio tracks all coming in at once. With the Mix Create, instead of tabbing out of your game, you can adjust the volume of all the tracks just by turning up and down the knobs. The routing table also allows you to choose exactly what your audience is hearing if you're streaming. This thing is packed full of features, but I'll let you answer the question.
