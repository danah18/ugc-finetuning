}, I went from feeling like this to feeling like this. Vertical Balance is my secret. To take the powder, you can either mix it with water, plant milk, or yogurt. This helps to stop bloating, digestive trouble, and skin issues. Have it just before breakfast, on an empty stomach. That's how the routine is way more effective. Ordering your probiotic in a packet is super easy. You can either order a one-time purchase, which is great if you just want to try it out, or you can jump straight into subscription, which is far more convenient. And they also have a 60-day guarantee, so it costs you nothing to try it out. Happiness starts with good gut health.
