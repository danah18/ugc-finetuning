}, I got the Aloha sample pack. They're vegan, soy-free, and don't contain any stevia whatsoever. Sounded good. These bars surprised me. Not only did they give a boost like I expected, but they taste really, really good. Sweet, but not heavy or overbearing. I got the sample pack because I can't decide which flavor is my favorite. And to be fair, I like the added variety to my routine. I'd suggest starting with the sample pack too. And if you like one of the flavors more than the others, you can go and order a full set of just that flavor. The taste is amazing, and I feel great buying from a protein brand that cares about including natural ingredients in their products.
