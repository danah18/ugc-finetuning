}, It's time to get real about laser hair removal. It's the best way to remove body hair, but it's so f***ing expensive. Most men typically require three to six laser hair removal treatments, totaling in thousands of dollars. Or you could spend under $300 just once and get the Fuzzgun IPL. It's all the power of laser hair removal, but you use it at home. It works in all your intimate areas, thanks to the Snowballs feature which cools the head of the device as it flashes away your hairs. Treat once a week for the first four to twelve weeks until you're happy with the results. It's that simple. Now off you go champ, get yourself a Fuzzgun.
