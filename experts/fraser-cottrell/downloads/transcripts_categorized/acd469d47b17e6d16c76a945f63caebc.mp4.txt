}, I'm gonna tell you about a true crime that is hygiene. When it comes to odor control, we have two choices. We have the deodorant and antiperspirant aisle for armpits, and then we have the mortification lane that's feminine hygiene. Nobody thinks anything of talking about deodorant for armpits. And what makes Lumi different is that we check that box in a really big way, but we do so much more than that. And we're able to do that because of our unique formula that every other company said no to, by the way, when I pitched it to them 15 years ago. And now it's catching on like wildfire. We put Lumi to the test. 12 hours after a shower with soap alone, the average armpit had an odor score of eight out of 10. We tested Lumi on some very challenging armpits. And our armpits are the stinkiest part on the human body. 12 hours after a shower with soap and applying Lumi, those odor scores were zero, no odor. So I'm here to debunk the hygiene industry. And Lumi's here to right the wrong because all body odor is the same no matter where it happens on your body. So you never have to walk down the mortification lane. You never have to think about just selectively using a deodorant in your armpits and soap everywhere else. Lumi has done the work for you and it's clinically proven to work better than a shower with soap, even if you shower twice a day. Give Lumi a try and experience whole new level of hygiene.
