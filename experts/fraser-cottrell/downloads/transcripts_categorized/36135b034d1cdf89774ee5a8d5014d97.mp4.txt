}, Here's everything that I eat in a day plus how I track my protein with my Fitness Pal Premium. So for breakfast I had two eggs and a little thing of vegan sausage and I just added that into the My Fitness Pal app and it shows me you know how much protein I got. Then for lunch I had a vegan tamale just because it was a super busy day and I like to have something really quick and easy and I actually used the scan the barcode feature to log that in and then I can check my macros through that. This was the tamale and then I had another protein smoothie for lunch slash a snack and again I added all of the ingredients into my fitness pal and I also used the scan the barcode feature again for some of the products that I could scan like the milk and the protein powder then I could see how much of macros that the protein smoothie had in it. And then for dinner I had some protein pasta with some vegan turkey. I added that in as well and then you can see sort of all of the food that I had. I can look at you know if I reached my goals that day all of the macros that I hit and targets and everything
