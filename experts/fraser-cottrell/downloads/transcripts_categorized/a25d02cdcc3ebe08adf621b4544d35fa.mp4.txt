}, I get asked a lot, what do I take to help my digestive problems? BioCult is the missing piece of my health puzzle. This is an all-in-one formulation which completely replaces all of your supplements. So take these two capsules first and then chase it with your prebiotic drink. Get the most out of this, take it every day on an empty stomach. I find that the mornings are best for me because it gives me a great start to the day. It's not just short-term results, you'll get brilliant long-term results as well.
