You see, we live in an age where people are starting to learn about the benefits of creatine on your everyday life, like improved performance, faster recovery, and nootropic effects on the brain. That's why I started a creatine gummy brand. And yes, they taste like sweets from your childhood. Also, Haribos. Good? Really good.
