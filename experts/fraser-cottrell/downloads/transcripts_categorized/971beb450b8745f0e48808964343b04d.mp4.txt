}, This is why we started the business. For years, my sister and I struggled with terrible irritations on our intimate parts due to shaving and waxing. Ingrown hairs, razor bumps, discoloration, itch, all those little nasties that you get when you remove your pubic hair. We asked our estheticians, dermatologists, gynecologists, and none of them could actually provide us with a natural and effective solution. There were also no products in the market that safely addressed our pubic hair situation. At that point, we really thought we were the only ones struggling with this and felt very self-conscious about it. Until the day we had enough and decided to start our own skincare brand. So my sister and I, now business partners, spent months and months researching and testing different product formulas. And we came up with this three-step skincare system for pubic skin and hair that completely changed our lives. From that moment, we vowed we had to share this with other women.
