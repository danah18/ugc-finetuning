}, Are your kids falling behind with schoolwork? This is where SofaTutor came in. It's an online tutoring service for kids in reception up to year six. SofaTutor uses cartoons to go through topics in an extremely creative and engaging way. And when they're ready, they can do the SofaHero game, challenging them on what they've just learned. And you can track their progress yourself on the site. SofaTutor has really put me at ease about my kids learning. It's allowed me to take an active role in making sure that they're learning what they need. Get on this if you've got kids at primary age, you won't regret it.
