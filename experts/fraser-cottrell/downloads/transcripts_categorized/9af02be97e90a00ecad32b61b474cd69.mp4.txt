}, A question I get asked often is what vitamins do I take? You may know SugarBear for their infamous hair gummies that improve overall hair health (P.S. they're delicious and vegan too!), but did you know they also have sleep vitamins with melatonin and women's multivitamins with omega-3 and vitamin C too?
