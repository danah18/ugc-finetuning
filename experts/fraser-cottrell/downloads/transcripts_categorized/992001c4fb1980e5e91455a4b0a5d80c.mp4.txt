}, All right lads, the secret's out. I've been using Grafted. Here's the never-before-seen techniques I use to look this good while on the job. First, you want to use the body wash. Beware, this is a highly complicated procedure. Apply Grafted face cream to your face. A lot of blokes mess this up, so please pay attention. Then, after a hard, long day working your hands to the bone, carefully apply some Grafted hand cream to your hands. Don't drop the bottle while doing this. All jokes aside, Grafted is a high-quality, no-fuss option that actually works, and encourages us grafting men to take care of our skin for a change. Vegan, cruelty-free, non-greasy, and heavy-duty for grafting skin. Get it on today and take care.
