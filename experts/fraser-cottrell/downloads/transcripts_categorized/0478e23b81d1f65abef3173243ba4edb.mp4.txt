}, What is the main difference between our toners? Our Glycolic Acid 7% toner is an exfoliating formula, making it good for texture, luminosity, and uneven tone. This can be great if you're a little bit more experienced with AHAs. Our Milky Toner is a gentler, milkier way to exfoliate. It gives acid-level results without the acid. NAG exfoliates gently, while squalene hydrates and supports the barrier. This can be a great option for more sensitive skin.
