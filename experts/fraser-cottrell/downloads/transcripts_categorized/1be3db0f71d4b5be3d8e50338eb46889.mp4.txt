}, Stop letting big corporations lie to you. We've all seen the commercials, more blades equals a better shave, and it's just not true. Cartridges with multiple blades are made from cheap materials that need to be replaced constantly, and the prices just keep going up. The shave may be easy, but your skin pays the price in bumps, burns, and irritation because the blades are designed to shave below the skin's surface. Single-blade razors have and will always be a superior, more affordable shave. Just ask your barber. And with Supplies SE Razor, making the switch has never been easier. It's designed with Nickstop technology to protect your skin from nicks and cuts, making single-blade shaving easy and enjoyable for everyone. The razor also comes with a lifetime warranty and a 100-day risk-free trial. Click the link below to join the single-blade revolution.
