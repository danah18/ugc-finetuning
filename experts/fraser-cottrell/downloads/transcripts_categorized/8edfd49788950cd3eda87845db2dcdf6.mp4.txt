}, This little tiny thing. Here it is next to my head for reference. It's called the Chorus Pod 2. It is basically a pacing tool for marathons, like the London Marathon that are in big cities that lose GPS. I have absolutely no idea the logistics of it or why it happens. So the GPS at certain points of a marathon kind of like taps out. It just interrupts your flow. So basically when you wear this thing, your GPS on your watch is linked to this. I'm going to be wearing this on Sunday because I know the London Marathon is pretty notorious for losing signal at certain points of the race. So how you use it. I have a Chorus watch. You sync this to your watch, clip it to your shoe, and then you run. All of the data just comes through your watch how you would usually use it, which is pretty cool. I've been testing it out on every single run that I've done this week. It works really, really well at the places that I normally lose signal, sometimes in areas where there's loads of high-rise buildings or going under tunnels. I've had perfect and consistent GPS throughout, which has been great. And it even worked on my hallway. This is the Chorus Pod 2. I will be using it on Sunday. I'm going to be so, so dialed in with my paces. Highly recommend if you live in a city or you're running a spring marathon or you just want more accurate GPS.
