}, Rub it on the edge and boom, itch is gone. I've suffered with itchy skin my whole life. But after discovering Smart Lotion, I have never looked back. It has been a godsend. Whether it be on my arms, legs, or face, I put a little Smart Lotion on and within five minutes, the itch goes away. It's FDA approved, it's simple, and it's easy to order from their online store. They have a subscription option so you can get resupplied automatically. It's so refreshing to find a cream that does exactly what it's promised. I always recommend this product to anyone with itchy skin, whether it be eczema, dermatitis, or anything else. If you're put off by the price tag, don't be. One bottle will last you a surprisingly long time. You really don't need to use that much cream at all. And if you're not satisfied with it, you have 60 days to get a full refund. So even if you're skeptical, it costs nothing to try it out. Smart Lotion delivered on all its promises when I tried it, and it'll deliver for you too.
