}, I bought two massage guns so I can compare them because there are so many on the market and I want to know which one's best. So this one I kept seeing pop up on Amazon, it's £100 and this one is from British brand Pulsio for £70. So first up, power. I've turned it all the way up, let's test it. It feels good but it doesn't feel like it's getting into my muscles. Next up, Pulsio. Ooh, that's instantly way more powerful. Okay, no composition on that one, Pulsio wins. Next up, noise. Pretty quiet. Now onto build and size. The Amazon purchase is made from plastic and Pulsio is made from aerospace aluminium and you can really tell the difference in the quality feel of the product. Then size-wise, if I'm taking this in my gym bag, this takes up so much more room. This is a lot more compact, it's not bigger than my phone. So personally for portability I'd go for Pulsio over this one. Overall I'd definitely make Pulsio my winner, it's small, it's compact, it's powerful, it's a really good price and I love it.
