}, I always thought protein bars weren't supposed to taste good, but I tried the sample pack from Aloha and I just can't stop eating them. I love all the flavors and they're the only protein bars that don't make me go to bed. Oh my god, I love that. I really like it. It really tastes like fudge brownie, but it's healthy. Okay, I think this is my favorite. I gotta try all the others. There's more chocolate here. They're full of clean ingredients with no stevia or any artificial flavors. I find the variety very satisfying. These bars are 100% natural and green. It's perfect. It's not even too sweet. It's like gold. Wow, this is my meal for the week.
