}, Imagine craving that perfect cup of chai. Rich, spiced, comforting, but you can't find it anywhere. That's exactly what happened to Ani and Ayan, two brothers who grew up with real chai, only to realize that in the US, what's called chai just isn't it. So they got to work, blending organic Assam tea, grinding spices by hand, cutting out sugar until they crafted the chai they'd been missing. They opened a store in the center of New York City, and it became a hit. Now, that authentic taste is here, and it's yours to enjoy at home whenever you want. Kolkata Chai Co., from two brothers who knew chai could be so much more.
