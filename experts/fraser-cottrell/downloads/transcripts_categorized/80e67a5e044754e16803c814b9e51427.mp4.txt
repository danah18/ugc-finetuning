}, It's rich, it's bold, it's authentic. You actually taste the chai and you'll never go back, I promise. I am proudly addicted to chai and the best out there is Kolkata Chai. Here's how I use their signature chai mix. First, take your water and bring it to a boil. Then put in your chai. It's made with 100% organic tea from India and hand milled spices, and you can really smell it too. I use about three teaspoons. If you want that extra spice, go right ahead and add some ginger to the mix too. Simmer it for about three minutes and then add your favorite milk. I customize it any way I want and it's always so good. Then you boil and then steep for three minutes and then you're good to strain and sweeten to taste. I usually go with agave. If there's a better morning drink, then I haven't found it. Chai lovers, get yourself a combo pack from Kolkata Chai today.
