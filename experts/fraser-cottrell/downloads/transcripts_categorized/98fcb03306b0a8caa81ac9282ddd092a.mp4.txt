}, What's all this popping I hear and feel?
Oh, yeah.
That's awesome.
Hey guys, Mckade here with Chirp. We're out in downtown Salt Lake City helping people feel good and do more.
Oh, that feels fantastic, actually.
Nice.
I like the texture of this, the pad is good, actually.
How do you feel?
Actually better. That does feel kind of nice.
Thank you.
Try this next.
Someone try it. It helps with that.
No, it helps with cracks.
You feel like a million bucks?
Yeah.
Love it.
It's really good.
I use it all the time. My husband uses it.
It'll help align your back and it totally cracks.
And it helps with my sciatica when I have sciatica issues too.
Gotta be careful because I'm gonna tell all my friends and everybody about this.
