}, This bodysuit, it snatches. Like my waist looks so... Do you guys see that? I am wearing Yiddy, which is a Lizzo's shaper brand, and it is so comfortable and soft. Something I would definitely wear underneath a form-fitting dress where I want a lot of smoothing going on. I wanted to show you guys what this dress looks like with no shaper, so you can see a little bit of like my tummy. Now that I have the shapewear on, you cannot see my tummy. It just looks flat, it looks smooth, and this is why I love shapewear.
