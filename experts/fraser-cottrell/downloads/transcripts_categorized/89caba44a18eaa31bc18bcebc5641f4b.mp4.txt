}, I have been trying really hard to cut down on my single-use plastic. Things like this deodorant just weren't cutting it for me. So when you order from Fussy, you'll get the case, obviously. Just pop off the top, and then there's these little notches on the side of the tube. Pop off as well. Take the refill, pop the refill into the case. So you basically just twist the bottom. The best smelling deodorant you have ever come across. I have the citrus smell, and it just is so fresh for the morning. You have to try this.
