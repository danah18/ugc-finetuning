}, I can't believe how smooth it is. It literally just glides over my skin. It's just so much better than those single-use razors that I always use. I used to hate shaving before, but I can't believe I haven't found Harry sooner. Such a clean shave as well. Come and feel this. The design is on point as well. You can see the colors are amazing. I just love that there's no gimmicks. Just simple, straight to the point, super, super easy to use. It's really, really secure in my fingers and on my thumb, so it doesn't slip. I haven't got a single nick. It's such an upgrade from my previous razor. Just get rid of your dusty old razor. There's no reason to use that. If you don't believe me, just go on the website and try it for yourself for just $5. Why haven't you tried this already? Hit the link and check them out.
