Well, it's been a month since I started using the Harlan MD Smart Lotion on my eczema and when I tell you it's been life changing, I am not making this up. Y'all, I've had terrible eczema my whole entire life. Dermatologists have recommended creams, they've recommended steroids, and nothing has worked for the long term until I found this Smart Lotion. It's cleared up my eczema scars and I am just so happy. I'm feeling so much more confident now that my skin has cleared up tremendously. Definitely recommend Harlan MD for those who have stubborn eczema that doesn't want to go away.
