Three reasons my kids think I'm mom of the year. Number one, I'm awake in time to make them a quality breakfast. Number two, I'm not scrambling anymore, so they're never late to school. And number three, now I have energy for all their activities. And it's all thanks to an app called Rise. I downloaded it, took their quiz, and found out that I had 25 hours in sleep debt. Rise showed me how to pay that debt back and even suggested the perfect time for me to go to sleep and the most ideal time to start my morning. The best part is it syncs to the family calendar. Rise shows me my peak energy levels throughout the day, so I'll always know when I'm going to be at my most productive. I'm serious, I have never felt better. Take the quiz and see how much sleep debt you have.
