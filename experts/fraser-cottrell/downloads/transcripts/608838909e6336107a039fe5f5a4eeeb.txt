Here's exactly what has happened to me after a month of supplementing these creatine and electrolyte gummies. Within the first few weeks, they help me get more toned, feel stronger and recover at a faster rate. I could push through those extra reps that used to feel impossible. My endurance during workouts feels easier and I'm seeing the definition in my arms and legs more frequently. The best part? Zero bloating and no upset stomach like I used to get with powder supplements. Creatine is the most studied supplement in the world and now I understand why. These gummies make it so easy. They taste amazing and I actually look forward to taking them every day. Plus, they're informed, spot certified so I know exactly what I'm putting in my body.
