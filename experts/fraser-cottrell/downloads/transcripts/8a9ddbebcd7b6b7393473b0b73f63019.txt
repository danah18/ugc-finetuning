Here are three mistakes your doctor may be making and one trick for eczema-free skin without a prescription. Mistake number one, not addressing diet. Alcohol and inflammatory foods can wreak havoc on your skin. Make sure to plan your meals according to your skin's needs. Mistake number two, too many prescription steroids. These drugs are great for the initial control of thick, severe flare-ups. But when used beyond two weeks, they can actually make eczema worse. Anyone who suffers from SWS will tell you that it's not a fun experience at all. So always weigh up your options before making this step. And number three, perhaps the biggest mistake, not addressing the root causes of eczema. That's why I recommend Smart Lotion from Harlan MD, as it provides complete healing to the two root causes of eczema, which are inflammation and imbalance in the skin's microbiome. Smart Lotion provides prebiotics for microbiome balance, healing polymers for skin barrier repair, and a safe anti-inflammatory to stop painful rashes. This cream is also an FDA-approved anti-itch cream, so it'll also provide relief for that pain as well. When used daily, Smart Lotion provides a 95% success rate for clear, eczema-free skin.
