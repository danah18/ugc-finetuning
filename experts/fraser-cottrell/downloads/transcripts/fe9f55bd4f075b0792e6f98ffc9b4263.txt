Keep grafting every day and my hands are battered. You've grafted hard, now take care of yourself. And this is why I am buzzing for grafted skincare. A no-nonsense skincare brand, no bullshit. Hands, face and body products all for the grafter. If you're exposed to all these elements at work, hit the gym or love extreme sports, then this product is for you. Now, a lot of guys will tell you that they don't care about the skin, but you know they are the same ones that are raiding their Mrs skincare cabinet to get some skin product on the hands. But all that stuff that your girlfriend or your wife uses just simply won't work for you. Grafted Skincare are partnered with Andy's Man Club, a charitable organization which is trying to get men talking about all things mental health, so make sure you go check them out too. I am pumped for grafted. At work, you would always bring the right gear for the job. Now get the right gear for yourself and snap up the skincare products too. Get yourself over to graftedskincare.com and be the first to hear about their new launch. Hardworking products for hardworking men.
