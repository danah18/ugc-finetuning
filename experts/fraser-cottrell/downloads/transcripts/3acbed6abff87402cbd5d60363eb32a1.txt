My kids use SofaTutor to get them up to speed outside of school. Here's why. One, it's a gamified tutoring experience where kids will have fun doing it. Two, SofaTutor lets your kids learn at their own pace. Three, easy to track their progress as they move through the app. Four, fully printable worksheets. Five, comes with a 30-day free trial. So if you've got younger kids who need a bit of extra help, you should at the very least check this out.
