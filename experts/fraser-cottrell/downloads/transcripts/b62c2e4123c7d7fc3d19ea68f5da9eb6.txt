If you're not grafting hard, then skip this video. My hands are full of calluses, and that's because I hit the gym hard every day. I don't really think about what I use my hands until I was sent this from Grafted Skincare. It's skincare that actually works for men like me, and it really just does the job. Before this, I was using my Mrs. Skincare, and honestly, it left my hands smelling like flowers, all greasy. I couldn't really touch anything for about an hour afterwards. Grafted makes my hands feel great, and I'm ready to get straight back into lifting after rubbing it in. But the thing I love the most about Grafted is that it's simple. It does what it says and more. I won't find any BS ingredients in it. It's just nice and easy. Order it today and get 10% off and get straight back to Grafted.
