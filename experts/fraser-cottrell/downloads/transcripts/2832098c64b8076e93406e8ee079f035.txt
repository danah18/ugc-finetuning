I'm eating this bar so fast. I finally got my Aloha bars with ingredients sourced from Hawaii. Let's go! Fully vegan and made from premium ingredients, you can really taste the fresh coconut and that Kona coffee? Perfect. They always say it's the best coffee in the world and I think they're right. Aloha Likon bars are super grainy. This is like perfect. It's almost like eating a cookie. You can get a pack of six from Aloha, but hurry because this is a special edition. You do not want to miss out on this. Order yours today from aloha.com.
