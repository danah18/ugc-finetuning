I found the healthiest bars out there, in my opinion. Let me tell you about Aloha. I just bought the sampler pack just so I can try every single flavor they have. Organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, no stevia, nothing artificial, and vegan. It was really important for me to find a plant-based protein bar that was tasty, and I feel like I hit the jackpot with Aloha. I need to keep my Aloha protein bars close by to make sure I always get my plant-based protein and my nutrition.
