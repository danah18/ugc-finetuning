Catching your kids up outside of school can be a very daunting task and I'm always worried about mine falling behind. This is where Sofa Tutor came in. It's an online tutoring service for kids in reception up to year six. Sofa Tutor uses cartoons to go through topics in an extremely creative and engaging way and when they're ready they can do the Sofa Hero game, challenging them on what they've just learned and you can track their progress yourself on the site. Sofa Tutor has really put me at ease about my kids learning. It's allowed me to take an active role in making sure that they're learning what they need. Get on this if you've got kids at primary age, you won't regret it.
