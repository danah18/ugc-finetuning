Like a bear down there? That's because you aren't using a fuzz gun. The Fuzz Gun IPL zaps off annoying body hair, stopping it from coming back. Use once a week, stay consistent, and then once you see a big improvement, switch it to only using once a month. You'll be amazed at the difference. Get over to Dude Pruner and get a fuzz gun. Tame the beast.
