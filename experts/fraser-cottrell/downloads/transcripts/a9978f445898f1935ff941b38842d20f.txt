The number one top seller from March. This strapless bra, I can't even take credit for it. It is wire-free, the most comfortable strapless bra. I would always avoid wearing tops like this before and now I grab them all the time like just hanging out, working from home. It has little silicone things right here which I've had strapless bras that have this before and it didn't work, they still slid down but this one does not. It's the best ever. Follow the blue arrow, click that, it'll send you to this. The best purchase ever.
