How I get enough protein as a vegan pregnant with twins. Pregnant women need 75 to 100 grams of protein, so I've been drinking these vegan own protein shakes, and they're ready to drink shakes with 20 to 35 grams of protein. These two are my favorite flavors. They're so good. They're also a really good source of iron, which is super important during pregnancy, and Trey really likes them too. He likes the 35 gram pro elite ones. One of my favorite things about these shakes is that they're low sugar, no gluten, no dairy, no artificial sweeteners.
