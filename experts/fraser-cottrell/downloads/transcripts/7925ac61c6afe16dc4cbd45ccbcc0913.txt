Smart Lotion is the only eczema cream I've used that actually did what it promised. Here's a before and after of an eczema patient who used Harlan MD. That is a huge difference. People don't understand the pain and discomfort that eczema sufferers go through every single day until it happens to them. I tried fixing my diet, immunosuppressants, prescription steroids, and every type of lotion recommended to me, but they all had limited success or they were very disruptive to my lifestyle. This is where Smart Lotion stands out. It's the only cream that keeps your skin healthy while stopping inflammation. You just dab a little bit on your skin and you're good to go. It doubles as an awesome anti-itch cream too, so I recommend it for that alone, dermatitis or not. This product is really freeing. Harlan MD really know what they're doing because they give you a 60-day satisfaction guarantee with your purchase. After you try Smart Lotion, I don't see you going back to any other options. I really don't. Get yours today and clear up that eczema.
