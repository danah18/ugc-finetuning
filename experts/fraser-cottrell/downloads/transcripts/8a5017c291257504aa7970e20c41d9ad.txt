I'm a graphic designer, and here's how I use my vibe board to bring ideas to life. Step one, mood board, all in the canvas app. Look at all the space I have to work with. Step two, initial sketches, and all this can be shared with my team for easy collaboration. Step three, incorporate feedback. I can quickly annotate and leave comments while taking my call. I can get two times as much stuff done because of this. Step four, final draft time. I can send it over to my client via link or email. It's as simple as that. My favorite part, I can use all my favorite workflow apps. Figma, Canva, Vimeo, you name it.
