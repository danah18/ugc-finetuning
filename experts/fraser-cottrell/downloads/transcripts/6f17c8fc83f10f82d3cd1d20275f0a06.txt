I've been on a mission to find a snack bar with high protein, low sugar, no stevia or any other artificial ingredients, and I have finally found it. Aloha bars are 100% natural with no other extra stuff, just plant-based ingredients. Plus, these are the best tasting protein bars I have ever tried. On their site, I ordered their sample pack where you get 12 bars in six different flavors. My favorite are the peanut butter and chocolate chip. These aren't too dry like other protein bars out there, nor are they too fudgy. These are just right. These keep my hunger in check and give me a much needed boost throughout the day. I am extremely happy to find these not only because they taste good, but these are exactly what I was looking for.
