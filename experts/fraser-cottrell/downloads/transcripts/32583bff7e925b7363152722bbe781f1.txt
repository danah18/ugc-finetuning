So I've seen the Besha products online on Instagram and with a lot of the brands I don't always know if it's going to live up to its expectations. I'm always a bit reluctant to try it. Anyway, I got the serum, the anti-aging cream and the cognac sponge. I do have quite sensitive red dry skin that gets quite flaky and irritated. I've only been using these products for about a week and a half. You can already see my redness has already gone down quite a bit. So I do usually have quite red cheeks, red up here, patches. So for me, my skin's actually looking really glowy and dewy. To me, that's already feeling just so much more hydrated and dewy. And that's from like a week and a half. So I can't wait to see what it's going to look like within a month of using it or two months of using it. But yeah, definitely really good for my sensitive dry skin. So give it a go.
