So I've been trying out this new maxi protein powder, and let me tell you, it is amazing and exactly what I was looking for. It's a tasty flavoured pudding and it is so easy to use. I just add a scoop to my shake and boom, instant energy boost, all thanks to the high levels of vitamins and B6 in the powder. Plus, unlike other shakes, parts have been so gritty, this has so much texture and it's proper protein powder, but this is it. So it comes in strawberry chocolate and vanilla, and it's sugar free, gluten free, low in sugar and low in fat. So whether you're just hitting the gym or trying to get more protein into your diet, maxi protein powder is the way to go.
