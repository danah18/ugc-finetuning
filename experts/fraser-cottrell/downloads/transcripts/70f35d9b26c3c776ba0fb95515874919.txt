The deodorant I find in the shop, that's not lasting long. So I make my own. When I started out making the black stuff, I wanted to make a deodorant that actually lasted all day, no matter what you were doing. And after tons of trial and error, I think I made 40 plus different versions. And the best part is, it's still 100% natural, meaning it won't irritate your armpits, and you actually know every ingredient that's on the label. So ditch the cheap old sprays and try one of our 12 unique scents that'll actually last all day long. Give it a try.
