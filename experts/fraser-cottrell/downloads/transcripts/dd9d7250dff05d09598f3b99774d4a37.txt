I love this bra. Not only is it gorgeous, I mean, look at the design here on the side, but it's functional. I absolutely hate when my strap is showing under my tops. And then let's say you're wearing underwire bras, right? And then you bend over, you go to pick something up, and it's like jabbing you in the ribcage. It's terrible. This is so smooth and soft. There's no type of wires. So if you're wearing like a fitted shirt, you know, nothing's going to be poking out or, you know, pushing through the shirt, nothing like that. The straps are super comfortable, they're actually adjustable, which is awesome. And also in the back, you can unclip, and you can cross back. I mean, this bra is an all-around winner. It's super easy to find the perfect fit. Just go onto the Honeylove website, hit up the sizing tool, answer a couple questions, and boom, you have your perfect fit.
