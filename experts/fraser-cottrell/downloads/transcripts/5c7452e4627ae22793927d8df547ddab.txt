This is gonna sound fucking random, but I haven't shaved my pubes in years. I just had an everything shower because I'm going on a date, and it reminded me that I literally used to spend almost an hour in the shower trying to perfectly shave my bikini line. I'm whispering because I have roommates. And then the day after, I'd look in the mirror and cry because of all the bumps, ingrowns, and irritations that I had from it. It was so, so bad. It looked like I had acne in my intimate area. But one day, I had a heart-to-heart conversation with my sister, and we realized we had the same struggles. Because, you know, I was feeling like I was not normal. She told me that it would happen every time she would shave, and she shaved, like, every two to three days because she had a boyfriend, and she wanted it to be smooth. It would get extremely red and super bumpy all the time. But the problem was that there were no natural solutions on the market. And trust me, we looked everywhere. We went to drugstores, department stores, pharmacies. We talked to doctors, gynecologists, estheticians. And none of them was able to give us a clear answer. So what we did was that we created our own solution. Basically, it's a five-step natural skincare routine that is going to replace your razor and prevent razor bumps and ingrowns from happening again in the future. Let me show you. It starts with Bye Bye Bouche. This is a natural hair removal cream. Keep It Clean is a cleanser that you apply every time you shower. Then we have Ingrowns Out. This is all you need. It has witch hazel, which helps a lot with ingrown hairs. Then you have the final touch. So this is a moisturizing oil. It makes my skin and my hair super soft. And this is the last one. This is a complement to Bye Bye Bouche. We launched this routine three years ago, and the feedback has been amazing. Every week, we receive awesome reviews from women saying that they love the products, they love that it's all natural, and that it works. I had no idea that one day, one of my biggest insecurities would turn into this. Anyway, I keep whispering because my roommates just left. Anyways, if you have weird skin, just ignore this. But in case you struggle, I did this routine for you. You can click the link if you want to check it out. Kisses. I need to go now.
