This toothbrush isn't for everyone. We know buying a toothbrush isn't easy, especially when every model looks the same and tells you features like six brushing modes, AI, and an app that connects to your phone are important. They're not. We're different. We're for people who care about buying brilliantly engineered, beautifully designed products that do one job really well. We got rid of gimmicks and pointless features so we could half the size of our brush whilst giving you a dentist-level clean. And we prioritize things that actually make your life better, like 40-day battery life and a whisper-quiet motor that won't wake your partner. We're for people who care about buying fewer but better products. Products that are designed to be repaired, not become obsolete. Or for people who want to live more sustainably and appreciate things like brush heads that are plant-based and recyclable. And for people who want things to put a smile on their face. We're Suri, the last toothbrush you'll ever need.
