Piss me or hate me, either way I'm back with 13 oddly satisfying blends in a BlendJet 2. Got a problem? Deal with it. This is how we roll. Don't drink this before a big date. This is what I do with unsolicited pics. Our new Excel jar has so mushroom. These blends are bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Taco Tuesday. Now in convenient drinkable form. We'd be eternally grapefruit if you gave this video a like. A friendly reminder to eat more whole foods. Every day I'm brusseling. Does this make me a cereal killer? Of course, you can always play it safe and blend up a classic smoothie. Just add milk, fruit, ice, and blend. Clean up is a cinch. Just add water, a drop of soap, and voila. You'll enjoy 15 blends before rapidly recharging with any USB port. Don't take our word for it. Trust the five-star reviews from millions of BlendJet customers. Fast and free shipping is included, along with a 30-day money-back guarantee. What are you waiting for? Order yours now exclusively from BlendJet.com. And tell them the Whisper Lady sent you.
