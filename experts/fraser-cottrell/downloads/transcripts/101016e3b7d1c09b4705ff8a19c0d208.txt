I've found a summer essential. I am sorry. But this... Give me it in every color. Imagine being out, you don't even have the worry of is my bum on short? Am I knickers on short? No! Because I'm wearing a skirt. I'm sorry but this is literally stunning. Why haven't I actually had one of these sooner? It's so nice from the front too because normally with skirts you can see that it's a skirt but it's like under there. I literally told myself this morning that I was going to stop spending my money. But before I stop spending my money, I need to buy this in every single color.
