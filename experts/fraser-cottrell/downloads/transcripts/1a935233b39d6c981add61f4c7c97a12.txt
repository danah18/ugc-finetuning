Stop scrolling if you still sleep in your boxers. Only frat guys sleep in their boxers. They're uncomfortable, super revealing, and don't have pockets. That's why I decided to upgrade to Jambies. These things are like if Lululemon and boxers had a baby. The material is so soft and stretchy, and the no-button fly keeps my goods secure. I sleep in them, I chill in them, I even work in them. Getting Jambies was the best decision I've made as an adult.
