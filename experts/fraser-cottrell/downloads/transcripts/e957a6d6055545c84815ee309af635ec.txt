This is the best soap you'll ever use, and here's why. Makes you smell fantastic. It revives me, I walk in through the door, the forest on a rainy day. All natural ingredients, handmade, no harsh chemicals. Don't get that drying effect. Doesn't smell like beer, smells amazing. It lasts till the very end of the soap's lifetime. My skin was softer. No matter how hard I'm working, whether it's freezing cold or burning hot out there, it keeps me dry, it keeps me smelling good. Makes your skin dry as a lamb. It got all these sensitive patches of dry skin cleared up right away. The menthol and peppermint, that rough feel, makes my skin feel great. I feel refreshed and much better every time I get out. The black stuff smells amazing. The scent is fantastic. I love it. These soaps are made out of the finest ingredients, but only the essential oils we use in them. There's nothing like having a shower after exercise, and the black stuff takes it to the next level. Feels amazing, smells great. This magic bar of soap got rid of a couple of dry patches of skin that I had. The products are top tier, first class, no better skin soap in the world, I think, in my honest opinion. I'm an old man, but I still like to smell great. I also did not expect the soaps to help clear my skin so much. Cannot recommend black stuff enough. I highly recommend giving the black stuff a try.
