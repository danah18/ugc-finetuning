It's dropped, the Kona protein bar from Aloha. You guys, I am so excited to try this one. When I heard about this special edition bar, I had to jump on it so quick so that I could tell you all about it. The Kona bar is so special because it has Kona coffee beans. They're ethically sourced right from Greenwell Farms in the Kona coffee belt. The flavor is totally one of a kind and can be found in Kona coffee beans. The Kona bar tastes truly special and you need to try this. Order now while stock lasts.
