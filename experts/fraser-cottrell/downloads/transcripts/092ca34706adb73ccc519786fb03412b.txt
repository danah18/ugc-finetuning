Oh my god, they're so extra! I can't believe I have my own! Oh, I love it! It matches your outfit. It does! Hi guys, I just received my water bottle from Tomo. I just want to share with you guys, if you're into water bottles, please invest in one of these. Very doable. I originally ordered just a silver one, but after I had that, I just needed to have even more. I couldn't stop. I actually ordered 13. All of the girls were sponsored by a brand called Tomo. They make the cutest bottles. Oh my god, look at how pretty this thing is. And we all got one. I mean, this is absolutely amazing. And when you purchase one of these bottles, it actually goes towards providing clean water. A glam water bottle. It has a logo at the bottom as well.
