I've got a problem. My boyfriend's got a fuzz gun and he's getting hotter. Here's why. Reason one, it can be used anywhere. It's got a cooling feature which makes it a breeze to use on your junk. Reason two, it's been a few months now and he looks like a freaking model. Guys, you don't realize how good you look when you control your body hair. Reason three, simple but important. This gun feels so good I can't keep my hands off of him. Guys, what are you waiting for? Go to Dude Printer right now and get a fuzz gun.
