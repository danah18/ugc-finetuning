Aloha protein powder tastes so fresh because it's made out of organic ingredients only. You can taste the difference immediately. I love it because it's not overwhelmingly sweet like some of the other protein powders on the market because it's sweetened with monk fruit instead of stevia. So instead, it just has a really smooth, tasty consistency that keeps me energized all day long. I highly recommend this powder out of all of the vegan powders out there on the market, and trust me, I've tried all of them. This is the best all around for health, protein, and taste. Delicious. I would put this in everything. Still has consistency and texture, so it's not like I'm just drinking vanilla water like some of the protein powders I've had. 10 out of 10 recommend Aloha protein.
