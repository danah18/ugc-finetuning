In the last ad I made for Barbell Apparel, I filmed my crotch while I did a squat, and apparently I got reported to the HR department for being inappropriate in my videos. So I was supposed to make an ad for these Covert pants, but now I'm not allowed to. So this is not an ad. But if it were, I'd show you that these pants are so tough, you can do yard work in them. And I'd tell you that they still look good enough that you can wear them for a night out on the town. You ready? Nice pants. I'd also tell you that just like everything Barbell makes, these have a lifetime guarantee. Meaning if you rip, tear, you get fat and you can't put them on anymore, Barbell's got you covered. And I'll still show you my crotch, no matter what you say, Jordan from HR. Screw you!
