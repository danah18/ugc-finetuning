I finally got my Aloha bars with ingredients sourced from Hawaii. Let's go! Fully vegan and made from premium ingredients, you can really taste the fresh coconut, and the Kona coffee? Perfect. I am eating this bar so fast. They always say it's the best coffee in the world, and I think they're right. Aloha Lycan bars are super grainy. This is like perfect. It's almost like eating a cookie. You can pack a six from Aloha, but hurry, because this is a special edition. You do not want to miss out on this. Order yours today from aloha.com.
