We always get questions about why we're so expensive, so let's address the elephant in the room. Why is AG1 more expensive than other greens powders on the market? So this is us, we're Athletic Greens, and we sell AG1. We source the highest quality ingredients from all over the world and concentrated extracts and forms that the body can easily recognize and use efficiently. Because we want our product to actually work and provide results. Another factor that plays in the cost of AG1 is that it's NSF certified for sport. Which, if you don't know what that is, it's the highest standard of quality testing for dietary supplements. The ingredient dosages of AG1 are verified to be in every single batch. It's safe, it's free of harmful contaminants, and to add another layer, it's free of 270 plus banned substances in major athletic organizations. Lastly, and maybe the biggest reason, is that AG1 is more than a greens powder. I mean, honestly, we're comparing apples to oranges here. Greens powders alone do not cut it for achieving the full benefits that many see with AG1. Our formula is a comprehensive supplement that gives you 75 foundational nutrients that you need for optimal health, including adaptogens, prebiotics, probiotics, and more. Every scoop of AG1 is meant to replace nine supplements that you could be taking every day. Each serving contains all of these vitamins and minerals. Check out our website to see the full list. Between our quality production process and the fact that we're quite literally more than a greens powder, we think we're pretty worth it.
