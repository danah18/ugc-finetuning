I have always struggled with body image issues because I was called fat as a child by my family. This is the story of the viral brand Pinsey Shapewear. I created Pinsey because there is a huge gap in the shapewear market. But the problem with normal shapewear is it's ugly, there's nothing stylish about it, it's uncomfortable, and it just doesn't fit well. And you end up feeling worse about yourself. One, you can go completely braless. Two, it acts as the perfect fitting, hourglass enhancing shapewear. And three, it's a stylish bodysuit that's made to be seen. Unlike normal shapewear, you can style our shapewear bodysuits from day to night as either an undergarment or an outer garment, like a normal piece of clothing. Say hello to cute shapewear that's super flattering and made to be seen because it finally exists.
