Here are three reasons why your eczema routine isn't working. Reason number one, you aren't being consistent with your routine. Reason number two, using creams that contain high-strength steroids. These drugs can be extremely effective, however, withdrawal symptoms are very common. These symptoms are very painful and can make eczema worse. Reason number three, using methods that don't address bacterium balance as one of the causes of dermatitis. This is why you should get Smart Lotion into your routine. It's the only cream out there that addresses both inflammation and bacterium balance in the skin. It not only clears up your itching, but also the root causes of dermatitis.
