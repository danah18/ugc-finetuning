I really like the texture of this because it's creamy and smooth. I feel like I'm in a fudge waterfall right now. Okay, the Aloha sample pack is my secret to staying healthy and satisfied wherever I am. They're delicious and I don't feel bloated when I eat them. This is bringing me back to my childhood of just snabbing bites of cookie dough, but this one's a lot more healthy for you. There's a little bit of a crunch too, so I guess it has a little bit of texture. So why not live your life on the co without compromising on nutrition or taste? Go to aloha.com and order your sample pack right now.
