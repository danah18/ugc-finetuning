I'm a graphic designer and the Vibe Board has revolutionized how I work. Step 1, mood board, all in the Canvas app. Look at all the space I have to work with. Step 2, initial sketches, and all this can be shared with my team for easy collaboration. Step 3, incorporate feedback. I can quickly annotate and leave comments while taking my call. I can get two times as much stuff done because of this. Step 4, final draft time. I can send it over to my client via link or email. It's as simple as that. My favorite part? I can use all my favorite workflow apps. Figma, Canva, Vimeo, you name it.
