I've been using the same deodorant since middle school. And it's a trash! Alright guys, let's see if the Black Stuff Natural Deodorant actually holds up. Ooh, smells classy, woodsy, fresh, with a hint of citrus. I'm gonna be honest, it's boiling out today, and if you're outside for more than five minutes, you're gonna be sweating. Five minutes in, still smelling fresh. It's a good start, let's go! Two hours in, and all I gotta say is this stuff works. Still no stink, no sticky feeling, I mean, come on now! Now it's been a full 12 hour day, and this deodorant hasn't let me down. No reapplying, no weird smells creeping in, I mean, still smells fresh as can be. It's nothing like the usual drugstore stuff. It's made with natural ingredients that stop odor instead of masking it. I'm not the only one saying this. Actually, tons of people say it's the only deodorant that lasted through long shifts, workouts, and crazy heat. And it doesn't irritate my skin at all. Dude, it smells freaking amazing. No chemicals, no gimmick, just long-lasting protection for the man who values quality. So I gotta say, the Black Stuff, you guys nailed this. If you're tired of deodorants that tap out halfway throughout the day, this is the one for you. Guys, go get it. Go get the Black Stuff.
