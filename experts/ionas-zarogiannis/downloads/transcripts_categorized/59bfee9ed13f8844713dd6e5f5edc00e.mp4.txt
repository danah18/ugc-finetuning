  "brand_name": "Pedialyte Powder Stick (Adult version)",
  "product_description": "A portable electrolyte powder aimed at adults, especially those who drink alcohol. It contains high electrolytes (like Pedialyte), ginger (for nausea), L-theanine (for anxiety), additional vitamins (for fatigue), and is easy to pack for on-the-go use."
}, The easiest way is to just show it to you in this video. So as you can see, Liquid IV has almost one gram of electrolytes and 11 grams of sugar. Pedialyte has almost four times the amount. So then we thought, let's take all the electrolytes out of Pedialyte and put them in a powder stick. But because we made ours for adults that drink and not kids, we added ginger for nausea, L-theanine for anxiety, and we made it portable and easy to pack for those on the go and some more vitamins for fatigue. So the chart is really the main difference. Gatorade doesn't even really come close to compare.
