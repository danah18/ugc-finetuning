Alpha Lion, superhuman pre-workout supplements designed to improve workout performance and provide effective dosing of key ingredients., Here's the number one reason the supplement industry is lying to you. Meet Beta Lion pre-workout. You see the word blend all over the ingredient panel? Let me show you why this could be very bad. The lackluster performance blend contains 1.6 grams total, but do you see how you don't know how much of each individual ingredient it contains? You need more than 1.6 grams of beta alanine alone, so this pre-workout is definitely underdosed. Your gains deserve so much better. What's even worse is supplement companies that have been getting away with this for years, so Alpha Lion set out on a mission to change that. After years of research, we launched superhuman pre-workouts to the world and it took off like wildfire, quickly becoming the most hyped up pre-workout of 2022.
