Modern Smile Design, Invisalign orthodontic aligners that discreetly straighten misaligned teeth for improved confidence and appearance, Hey Sarasota, does your smile ever hold you back? Do you ever feel self-conscious when you're looking at yourself in the mirror or taking photos? Well, you are not alone. Many of our patients feel the same way about their misaligned teeth. Hi, I'm Dr. Olga Dantova with over 27 years of experience and here at Modern Smile Design we transform thousands of smiles and we came up with the solution. It's called Invisalign. Invisalign aligners are clear and nearly invisible. They gently move your teeth into the perfect position. Each aligner you wear is not just about moving your teeth, it's about moving towards that smile that gives you real self-confidence. We are happy to announce our Invisalign Summer Special at Modern Smile Design. For the summer special, you get additional $2,400 off your Invisalign treatment. On the top of it, you get a complimentary consultation with me and also you get a toothbrush at the end of the treatment and a whitening kit which is complimentary and will make your smile shine brighter. We're one out of six certified digital smile design clinic in Florida which help us to show your outcome for the treatment prior to the treatment. So don't wait to feel your best this summer. This offer is for the first 10 patients this month. If you're ready to change your smile, boost that confidence, and be summer ready, click the Learn More button below and schedule your consultation with us.
