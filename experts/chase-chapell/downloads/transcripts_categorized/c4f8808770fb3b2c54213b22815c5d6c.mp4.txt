Topicals, skincare products for treating ingrown hairs, irritation, and hyperpigmentation on the bikini line and underarms, If you shaved and naired and have all the burns, all the ingrown hairs, this is a combo for you. Hi friends, welcome back to Girl Chat. I'm gonna put y'all onto products I wish someone would have told me about earlier and that I wish I would have started using earlier. If you are a girly that is self-conscious about your bikini line, if you shaved and naired and have all the burns, all the ingrown hairs, this is a combo for you. This is the Topicals High Roller and this is Topicals Faded Spray. I use these alternating days in my night routine after the shower. I've been using this on my underarms and my bikini area for the past couple months and I'm gonna insert my before and after pictures with dates and it has been working so well. It has specific ingrown hairs that I was watching to see if they would go away and they literally did. I'm just loving my results and I have a trip coming up and I am glad that I use these all summer and I feel confident going into my trip and wearing bikinis. This is your sign. Grab this duo.
