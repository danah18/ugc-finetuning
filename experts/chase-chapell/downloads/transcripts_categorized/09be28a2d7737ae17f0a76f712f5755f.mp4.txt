V34, an instant color-correcting tooth serum that reduces the yellow appearance of teeth and provides a whitening effect without causing sensitivity., Okay, so you apply it like this. Let's ensure full coverage to the tooth. And bam! Look at that. You can see the immediate color correction working on the surface of the tooth. Come have a look. And watch. Even as we wipe it completely off the surface of the tooth, you can see the result clearly staying put to leave that brightening effect to teeth. That's powerful V34 color correction technology at work. Let me explain V34 in 30 seconds. Imagine that this yellow balloon is a yellow stain. If I use the color purple, I can cancel out the yellow stain. Bleaching or whitening teeth is fundamentally about reducing the yellow tones of your teeth. Color correction achieves a similar, very desirable effect because it also reduces the yellow appearance of teeth, but it does so instantly. With color correcting, the result is entirely on the surface. Nothing is penetrating in, so it is entirely painless and causes zero sensitivity. So effectively, you are getting a painless and effective solution for yellow teeth. The proprietary blend of dyes that V34 uses effectively erases the appearance of yellow, so it's something that you can paint on and instantly the appearance of teeth looks very much whiter.
