I truly don't think I've ever been this dehydrated, ever. One, I may or may not have had myself a little night last night. Two, I'm traveling and I'm at a high altitude, which can make you dehydrated. Also have to ski all day today. I literally don't know how I'm going to do it. So to help me right now, my preferred method is Waterboy. It's extremely hydrating and also has added ingredients to help you bounce back. Be so for real. I'm literally going to throw up if I do this any longer. So I'm going to chug this and try to get through a whole day of skiing. I'll let you know how it goes. God, this is a little spicy. The only way we're making it down this hill right now is because of Waterboy. I've got a lot of courage.
