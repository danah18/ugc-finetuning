If you're a hot sleeper like me, then you've probably gone to the store and bought one of these cheap cooling blankets. The only problem is that they're thin like a bed sheet, so you don't get that comfort you would get from a traditional duvet. They're not machine washable, they're made with cheap fabrics, and they don't really work. That's why I decided to do something about it, and I invented the ice blanket. It took me over a year of research and a hundred different samples to create this blanket, but this thing is the coldest blanket on the market. Not only is it moisture wicking and machine washable, but it's temperature regulating. So what that means is that when you go to sleep at night, it's going to cool you down to the optimal temperature to fall asleep faster, but then it's going to absorb your body heat throughout the night, and it's designed to be thick enough to feel like a duvet, but still keep you cool all night long. I only have a couple hundred left, so make sure to grab them because the last time I dropped these, they sold out in like three days.
