Does your pre-workout give you the jitters? Most pre-workouts are riddled with stimulants to help you boost your energy levels. But the problem is all that energy can leave you feeling overstimulated, anxious, and jittery, making it hard to push yourself in training. We recognize that problem and aim to create a pre-workout that gave you a big energy boost while maintaining your ability to perform. That's why our bulk pre-workout contains effective doses of multiple cognitive enhancers like L-theanine, which has been shown to work synergistically with stimulants to help reduce jitters and boost focus and attention. If you're looking for a pre-workout that gives you a focused energy boost without all the pre-workout jitters, head to TransparentLabs.com and pick up a tub of bulk pre-workout today.
