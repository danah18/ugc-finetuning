Me and my husband have been combating foot and underarm body wash. He's been complaining about the scent, so I've been getting in a little peppermint tea tree for myself. Well, I found the perfect line. It's really designed for men, but totally unisex. The scent is original citrus and eucalyptus. The body wash smells amazing. It doesn't strip your skin. The shampoo and conditioner cleans and moisturizes your hair without weighing it down. The jury is still out on the deodorant. I'm waiting for my husband to try it. It smells so good, though. I think he's gonna love this.
