This is an amazing towel and helps keep our earth clean and it's awesome. The really cool thing about this is that 85% of it is made from recycled material. I've been using it a lot for yoga. It's also made of recycled material, which makes my environmental heart so happy. Honestly, it feels like so durable. You can use it for the beach, the pool, yoga, traveling, if you're camping. Really, it's so multifunctional. It's super portable, just fold it up and there you go.
