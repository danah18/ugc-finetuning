For $50 I got all the snacks, amazing produce, pantry essentials, drinks, and proteins that I can want for the week. I found that this was an amazing way to budget and not have to take time out of my day to go grocery shopping. And you guys, just look at this amazing haul. I'm so excited to try everything here. I love that I'm able to try new things and best of all, reduce food waste across America
