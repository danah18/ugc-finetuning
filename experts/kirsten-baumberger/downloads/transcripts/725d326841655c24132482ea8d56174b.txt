My life got easier once I realized it's not my responsibility to convince you to choose me or beg you to like me. I've decided to stop over-explaining myself and start getting used to people misunderstanding me instead. Because I have realized that I don't fit into a box, and I'm totally okay with that. Because the woman I am today is different from who I was yesterday and who I'll be tomorrow. I am constantly evolving.
