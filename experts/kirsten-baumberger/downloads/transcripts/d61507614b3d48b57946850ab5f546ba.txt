I absolutely love reading, so of course I had to try out Book of the Month. So I'm gonna do a little unboxing with you guys. I got two books in my Book of the Month box. I feel like this is such a fun way to get new books and also it gives you something to look forward to. The first book that I got is Dragonfruit. This is a little bit more of a fantasy book. The cover art also, I'm literally obsessed. This is gonna make a great addition to my bookshelf. I also got a Kristen Hannah book. This is her new book, The Woman. I'm very, very excited to read this one. If you are someone who loves reading like I do, I feel like Book of the Month is a perfect option to get some new books.
