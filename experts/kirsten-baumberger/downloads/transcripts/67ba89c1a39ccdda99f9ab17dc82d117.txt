This is Calliope and we're here to talk to you about Made by Nacho. Isn't this the cutest packaging ever? It says from Nacho with love and we're going to open it together. I got a bag of skin and coat support which is big for me because Thalia has a very nice coat and I love when it's shiny and it looks good and I like maintaining that. This is a variety so you have your chicken with shreds, turkey shreds, and cot tuna and cod flakes and they love their variety. I always get the variety packs because I like to switch things up for them. This one is already going feral for this food book. Okay we're gonna go feed her a treat.
