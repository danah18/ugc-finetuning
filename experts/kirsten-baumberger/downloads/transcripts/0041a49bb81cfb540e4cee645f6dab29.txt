Yo, I'm loving these oven mitts from Staff. They're BPA free food grade silicone and temperature resistant up to 450 degrees. They have a super soft cotton fiber inside that keeps your hands insulated and protected. They just have amazing grip all over so I never have to worry about dropping something when I'm pulling it out of the oven. And I just love the design. They're super fun and I've been getting tons of compliments. Go check out these mitts along with Staff's other amazing home goods at meetyourstaff.co.
