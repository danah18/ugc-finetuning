I just got the coolest piece of art from my home office. It's called a micro shell chair from this brand Mini MCM. And since I love having a colorful workspace, this is the perfect addition to the books and florals that I like to keep on my desk. It also makes the perfect holder for all of my sticky notes, and I just love how small details like this really bring my space together. These come in really limited quantities, so grab yours quick!
