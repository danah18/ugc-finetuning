One thing about me is that my day is not complete without a functional beverage. I'm trying a new one today. This is SunSip from Health-Ade. It is a prebiotic soda, which I love, so I'm excited to try a new one. Cheers. Ooh! This is the raspberry lemonade flavor. It's good. Really refreshing. I imagine having this on the beach and really enjoying that.
