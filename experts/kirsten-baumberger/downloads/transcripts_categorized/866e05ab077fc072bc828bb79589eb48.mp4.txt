}, It's so easy to set up your Saans air purifier. I was looking for a product to help keep my apartment dust and allergen-free while also looking very sleek, and Saans does just that. Saans cleans up to 1,560 square feet every hour. It's also the quietest in its class, and you can turn off all of the lights, making it perfect for placement in the bedroom. It's truly a breath of fresh air.
