}, Are you like me? Do you like wine but you aren't sure which wine you like? I consider myself a wine novice of the first degree, but I don't want to stay like that, so I was excited to try First Leaf Wine. First Leaf is wine made simple with personalized selections by an initial quiz based on your taste preferences so they know what types of wine to suggest for you. As you continue with them, you can rate the wine you received so they can further refine the bottles they send. But don't worry, you still have some control over your box with alternate choices they give you. And it's all very affordable with prices up to 60% off retail, and satisfaction is guaranteed. It's exciting to try new wines in every box, and the wines are award-winning, sourced from across 5 continents and 12 countries. Cheers to you, my future wine experts!
