}, I didn't even know they made anything besides deodorant. I got this package in the mail the other day. This is from Native. I've tried their deodorant before and I loved it. This is the tie-dye vanilla cupcake body wash conditioner and shampoo. I tried this out two days ago or something and this is my hair. This is two day old hair. Obviously you can't feel it, but it is so soft and silky. I use like $30 conditioner and $30 shampoo. And this is so much cheaper and it's so good and it smells so good. I smell like a cupcake all the time and I love that. Look at my hair. It's so soft and silky. I love it. I also forgot to mention the back of this shows you the ingredients. It breaks down all the ingredients to tell you exactly what it's for and like where it comes from. I am very picky about what I put on my hair and this is silicone free, sulfate free, and paraben free. It's amazing.
