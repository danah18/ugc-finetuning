}, Okay, we got the original jerk ranch and then the hot sauce. So I have some fries. I was eating them with ketchup, but now we're going to eat the hot sauce. This one is, it says it has a little heat scale. You can cook in these, you can dip food in these. Like they're very versatile. It smells really good. This is good. Oh, and spicy. The jerk ranch. I'm very excited. This one is definitely like not spicy at all. They kind of almost taste very similar, but one of them is creamy and not spicy and the other one is not creamy and spicy. Let's try the hot sauce. Oh, wait a minute. That one's kind of like sweet in a way. Definitely get these because these are really good. I think this was my favorite, but they all like taste really good. I'm going to keep eating my fries with these because these are really good.
