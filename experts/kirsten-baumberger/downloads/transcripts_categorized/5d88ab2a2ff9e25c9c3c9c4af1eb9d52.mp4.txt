}, I am a mom of two who's training for half marathon. I find it very difficult to get in all the protein that I should be getting in on a daily basis. Enter Seek Clear Protein. I am so freaking excited about this. This is going to be my newest training bestie. It's a clear protein, so you just add water and ice, shake it up. I love the mango pineapple, so delicious. It has 22 grams of protein, zero grams of sugar. I traditionally hate protein powders. This is so good
