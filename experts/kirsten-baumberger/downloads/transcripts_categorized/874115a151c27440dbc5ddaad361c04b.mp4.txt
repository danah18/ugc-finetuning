}, Size matters, at least, I thought so. This is Mini MCM Edition 1 Microshell 10, and they sent me one. And as you can see, it is tiny. But I just love how modern and clean it looks and how it's not like any other decor I've ever owned. And I can't decide whether I should put it on the living room shelf or the cube shelf that's over here in the office or the floating shelf that's right above my setup. Let me know what you guys like best though.
