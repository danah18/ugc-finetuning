}, This just might be the best hat ever invented. This ponyback hat has a patented magnetic opening that is big enough to fit two of my hands. You can close it on a really high ponytail or a really low ponytail. So you can wear a hat no matter how your hair is styled. I love it. Ooh, I love it. This is so me.
