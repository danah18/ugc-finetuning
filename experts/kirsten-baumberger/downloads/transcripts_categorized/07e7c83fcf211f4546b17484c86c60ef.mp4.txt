}, Hey besties, this probably is the coolest thing I've ever received in the mail. Tidbit sent me their retro style display and the cool thing is is you can download their app on your phone and you can do any customized sayings or you can choose what they have available on the app. But look how cool and stylish and sleek this is. I cannot wait to put this in Steph's studio. I think they're gonna really love it.
