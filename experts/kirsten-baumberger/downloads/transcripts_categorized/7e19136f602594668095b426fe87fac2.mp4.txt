}, Make a Copper Cow coffee with me. Copper Cow coffee is premium coffee that is simple and quick to make. I'm going to be making a Vietnamese-style drip coffee, so I'm going to be using this line as a guide. This is their vanilla flavored coffee, which comes with a bag to do a drip style. All you do is open the bag, place it on your mug, and pour hot water over. The mug is super helpful because all I did was keep pouring water until the coffee drip reached that Vietnamese-style line that I wanted. Next, I added the creamer, which is sweetened condensed milk. It's super helpful to have the creamer and sugar all in one, and it came out really good. I added part of the creamer packet into the coffee and then gave it a stir. I prefer iced coffee, so I just poured the hot coffee over ice and then added a little more ice so it was nice and cold. It was so easy to make if you want a good cup of coffee, especially quickly. Cheers!
