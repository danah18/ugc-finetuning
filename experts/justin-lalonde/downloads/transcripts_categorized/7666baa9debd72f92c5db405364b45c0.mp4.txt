}, I seriously wake up and look forward to drinking AG1 every morning. It really is more than just a multivitamin. AG1 is a comprehensive and convenient daily health drink. It has digestive enzymes, probiotics, adaptogens, everything in just one scoop. I'm helping my gut health, giving myself natural energy, promoting healthier aging, and it's even good for hair and nails. My favorite part is how easy it is to incorporate into my morning routine. All you got to do, scoop, mix, and drink. You're good to go. Now I don't have to have a bunch of supplements in my cabinet because everything I need for vitamins and minerals is in one scoop of AG1. You've got to check out Athletic Greens for yourself. You're going to love it.
