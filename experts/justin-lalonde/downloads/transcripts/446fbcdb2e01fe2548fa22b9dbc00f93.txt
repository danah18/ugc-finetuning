This is the Cuts AOT. It's slim fitting, and it comes in a bunch of different colors and styles. Once you get used to a shirt like this, your old baggy shirts just look and feel ancient. We typically never update our wardrobe. A lot of guys are still wearing the same shirts they wore in college. I was skeptical about buying clothes online, but then I found Cuts and it changed everything. These shirts drape so nicely over my shoulders, they have a nice tapered fit around the waist. Basically, it's the modern T-shirt. Okay, they're literally the only shirts I wear now. Go get yours at CutsClothing.com.
