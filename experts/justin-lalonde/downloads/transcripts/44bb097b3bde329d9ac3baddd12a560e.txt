Remembering to take all of my supplements is a lot sometimes, and this is so much more than just a greens powder. It's got all of your vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and more. I don't need to take a bunch of different supplements anymore, it's all right in here. It supports my immune system, my gut health, and I've even noticed an improvement in my hair and nails. One scoop of AG1 is packed with 75 vitamins and minerals like ashwagandha, vitamin C, and magnesium, as well as other whole food ingredients that your body needs. All you have to do is scoop, mix, drink, and you're done. Right now, if you order athletic greens, you're going to get a year's supply of this liquid vitamin D and five of these travel packs, which are perfect for traveling or taking them at work. You have to check out athletic greens for yourself.
