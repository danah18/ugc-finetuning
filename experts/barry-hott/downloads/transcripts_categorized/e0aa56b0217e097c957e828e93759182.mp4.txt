}, Okay, okay. Don't tell my boss, but all I do before work every morning is roll out of bed, throw some pants on, run down to my fridge, grab a nice cold cup of cold brew, and that's it. Start working. Wandering Bear cold brew wakes me up right in time for work, and I get going. That's it. Plus, the beautiful thing about this, I never run out. I subscribe, so there's always a box on deck right when I need it. Never have to worry about it. Never go to a coffee shop. Never, like, wasting money on that, wasting time. Just easy as can be. Roll out of bed, grab my coffee, and I am good to go. Get it. Wandering Bear. Wandering Bear coffee. This one's vanilla. I love it. What are you still doing here? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
