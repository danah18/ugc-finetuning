}, Why was I paying $25 when it's way cheaper to get it from Harry's? Gillette has been charging us higher prices for blades forever. Want to know why? Because they could. And that's why we started Harry's. I wish I knew about Harry's sooner. I didn't spend way too much money on razors. We try to make awesome blades and we think we do. Usually this is where I would get cut or nicked right here. Look at that. That's impressive. Five blades, just like Gillette, and a precision trimmer on the back, just like Gillette, and an aloe strip, just like Gillette, for a fraction of the price. As you can see, there's no razor burn. Nothing missed. Very, very smooth. Good quality. They start at $2 each. They give you an amazing shave at a much, much better value. This was a premium experience. Seriously. It's super easy. Come to our site. We have a $5 trial. If you don't love it, it's on us. For it to just be able to show up when I need it, that's a no-brainer. Shop is a baby. Harry's for the win, guys. Harry's for the win.
