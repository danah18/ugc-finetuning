}, These are the three things that have dramatically helped my mental health. Number one is getting medication for my anxiety. I use a service called Minded. It is so much more affordable than traditional psychiatry. Second is therapy, which is such a great complement to medication. The third thing is implementing self-care practices like going for walks daily, eating healthy food. I highly recommend Minded. Go check them out.
