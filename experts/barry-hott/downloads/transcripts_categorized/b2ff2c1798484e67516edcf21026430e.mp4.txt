}, I convinced my boyfriend to switch from Levi's to the perfect jean and this is why. First up is the fit. They carry sizes from 26 to 50, different lengths, and they have a ton of different fits for every body type and my man's has been looking a little extra good in his jeans as of late. Number two, they are comfortable. These have four-way stretch. My boyfriend was doing squats when he first tried them on because he could. And they mold to fit every last bit of you, if you catch my drift. And last is the price point. These are $79.99 whereas my boyfriend used to spend a hundred plus on every pair of Levi's. So I highly recommend, ladies, pick up a pair from the perfect jean for your man.
