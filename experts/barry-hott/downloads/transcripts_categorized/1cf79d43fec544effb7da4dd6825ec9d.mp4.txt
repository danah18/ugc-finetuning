}, Here's my car under the nice platinum cover from carcovers.com. Look at that, sparkling clean, good as new because I just got it washed right before I put it under the cover. It's been raining, the weather's been terrible, but the car is safe thanks to carcovers.com. The other thing I like about my car cover is that I'm in this tight parking lot here. Usually there's cars here and I don't really care as much if someone's going to open their door and it's going to bump into my car. It is going to protect it from light scratches and dings, which makes me feel better. I don't understand why all of these other cars don't have car covers. It is crazy to me. Most of these cars are not driving anywhere. These people probably all work from home like I do or work nearby and they're not driving every day. So if you're not driving every day, why not cover your car? It's super simple and a great way to keep your value in your car. I don't understand. Go get one from carcovers.com. This is the Platinum Shield outdoor cover. Keeps my car clean, safe. I literally don't know why you're still watching this ad. Click the ad right now. Go get yourself a car cover.
