My dad is obsessed with this freaking licorice. He already finished this one and he's on his second. This is from licorice.com. This is super fresh, packaged, sent straight to you, and is way higher quality, way more flavor than you'll ever have in the local candy store. I've never had anything like that. That is good. At the stores you get the same boring flavors that honestly feel like plastic. But over at licorice.com they've got 50 plus flavors and 42,000 five star reviews. Go right now, licorice.com, click the link. I don't know why you're still here. Bye.
