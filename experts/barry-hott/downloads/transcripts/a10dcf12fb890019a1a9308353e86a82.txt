Tell me about the time you got into the most trouble with your parents. Wow, I got arrested for trying to steal a car. What? All right, I'm gonna let you hear the rest in a second, but if you're interested, click after. Click this link after you're done watching my dad tell me an embarrassing story. Check out Tails, the interview kit that enabled this amazing experience I just had with my dad. Again, that's tails.com. Check it out. I was walking home from a date with a girl in Great Neck Estates, and there was a gas station, and I don't know what prompted me to look in. There was a Corvette. Okay. In this Corvette, it was parked in the side of a gas station, and the keys were in it. So I was trying to drive this car away from this gas station just to take it for a joyride, and a police car pulled up, and they took me to the Great Neck Estates police station and called my parents and my father had to come and get me. That's insane. Thanks to Tails for giving me all these weird questions to ask my parents and get to know my favorite people on the planet a lot better. Love you, Dad.
