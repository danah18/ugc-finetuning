I want you to tell me about the time you got into the most trouble with your parents. Wow. Okay. Well, I would say probably there's a couple of times. I'm going to let you hear the rest in a second, but if you're interested, click this link after you're done watching my dad tell me an embarrassing story. Check out Tales, the interview kit that enabled this amazing experience I just had with my dad. And that's tales.com. Check it out. When I was 16, when I got arrested with my sister, I think my brother Larry was with us, and a couple of other kids, I don't know who they were. And I was driving with a doctored license because I only had a junior license. And the reason we got pulled over is because this idiot who was in the car with us yelled out the window, the fuzz suck. Someone in your car? To a cop? To a cop. And then instead of pulling over, I tried to outrun the cops. How are you not in jail? I pulled over and my parents had to come and get us from the East Hampton police station. And then we had to come back months later and go to court. And remind me, what do you do for a living? I'm a lawyer. Great. Which probably was the reason, but I'll tell you, the year before, I got arrested for trying to steal a car. What? I didn't know any of this! This has already paid for itself. Alright, go on. I was walking home from a date with a girl in Great Neck Estates. And it was a gas station. And I don't know what prompted me to look in, there was a Corvair. In this Corvair that was parked in the side of the gas station. The keys were in it. And it was a stick shift, which of course I knew how to drive already. Because I had been stealing school buses since I was 12. Okay, okay. Are you currently wanted, Criminal? No, I'm not. But I never got caught for stealing a school bus. Are you the star of Gone in 60 Seconds? Is that a true story about your life? It's true. Boosting cars? So I was trying to drive this car away from this gas station. Just to take it for a joyride. And a police car pulled up. And they took me to the Great Neck Estates police station. And called my parents. So they all had to come and get me. And I never got arrested for that. Oh my god. It was the local, you know, the Kensington cops in the Great Neck Estates. Whose car was it? I don't know. I have no idea. Some customer at a gas station. So those two instances kind of rival each other. How many other times have you been to jail? No, I never got to have been to jail. I've been to jail as a lawyer for clients. Okay, good. Amazing. Alright, well, thanks. I learned something new about you. Holy cow. That is, that's crazy. Click now to get the interview kit from Tails.com.
