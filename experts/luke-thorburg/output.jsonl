One day she says, I want to take you to this supplement expert. At the time I was kind of like, you know, this is mumbo jumbo. I'm a 17 year old kid. I'm like, these naturopath doctors aren't real. This sounds like BS. She pushes me through, she gets me to do it, and I agree, reluctantly. So we go to this naturopath doctor and they give me this high dose arnica supplement, super high dose. Within two days, my hearing comes back completely. And this isn't like made up in my head. I had gotten my hearing tested. I had 2% hearing left. Went back to the doctors, got it retested up to 89, 90% hearing. So this really happened. It was documented. And from there I became a huge believer in supplements. I was obsessed with supplements. I spent all my time researching supplements. I worked at GNC, taking 50, 100 supplements a day sometimes, just absolutely obsessed with supplements. So when I started Physician's Choice, I came up with the idea, hey, I want to start a supplement company with the highest quality supplements, efficacious supplements, high doses that I would take myself or I would recommend to my parents, my family members, supplements I would actually use, things I really believed in.

Most beauty products nowadays are just a waste of time. They mess with your hormones, they barely work to do what they say they will do, and keep you buying them month after month until your bank account is empty and you're left with no results. This was happening to me too. I was stressed and unhappy and I just felt like there was no solution to my skin. Until one day, my friends in our group chat recommended Seitu Skin Combo. Seitu Skin Combo comes with two products, the Youthful Powder and the Skin Renew Tablets. The Youthful Powder is packed with Type 1 and Type 3 marine collagen, and it's scientifically proven to rejuvenate your skin and combat signs of aging. As we age, our body loses collagen, which then leads to the fine lines, wrinkles, and just the general aging of the skin. So this powder stops that in its tracks and works its magic to take away those fine lines for good. Then comes the Skin Renew Tablets. These little beauties are powered by glutathione and vitamin C, which are both clinically proven ingredients that effectively combat dark spots and give your skin a radiant glow. These two combined mean that you can nourish your skin from within and not just from without. And what exactly makes it different? It's clinically proven to work and its method is backed by science, unlike so many other beauty products. Plus, there's no harmful chemicals, side effects, or GMO ingredients. So say goodbye to hormonal imbalances or breakouts. And they have free shipping and a 60-day money-back guarantee, which means if you use it for 59 days and see no results, you get all of your money back, no questions asked. So, if you're serious about achieving clear radiant skin and saying goodbye to those endless cycles of ineffective skincare products, Seitu Skin Combo is your answer.

Only three weeks of drinking this and I was a completely different person at my graduation. I felt so relieved seeing my pimples gradually clear up, redness reduced, and even noticed my skin became more smooth.
