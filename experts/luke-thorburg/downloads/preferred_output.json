We have so many reviews on our website from people saying they are noticing a decrease in their fine lines and wrinkles.

So you've probably seen these sticky pads before. This is what I grew up using. You step on them, and the adhesive pulls any dirt or anything off the bottom of your shoe. The problem with these are, the effects only last a couple of seconds, and the adhesive that they actually use sticks to the bottom of your shoe, picking up even more dust when you start playing again. So what edge spray is, is basically like traction in a bottle. They got a bunch of smart people together and invented a formula that bonds with the rubber of your shoe. It instantly increases your grip on the court and counters dust from getting on your shoe in the first place. All you do is spray it twice like this, wait a few seconds, kick the ground, then you'll have grip that lasts the whole game. And don't worry, sneakerheads, it's perfectly safe for your soles and actually extends the life of your shoes. No one likes getting their ankles broken, so check out edge spray.

Spring break trip with some friends, a horrible head injury. I lost hearing in one of my ears, completely lost hearing, just gone. I was deaf, came back, I was going to doctor after doctor. My mom was taking me to a bunch of different doctors. One of them actually told me I needed brain surgery, but that might not fix it. It was just like horrible news after horrible news. One day she says, I want to take you to this supplement expert. At the time I was kind of like, you know, this is mumbo jumbo. I'm a 17 year old kid. I'm like, these naturopath doctors aren't real. This sounds like BS. She pushes me through, she gets me to do it, and I agree, reluctantly. So we go to this naturopath doctor and they give me this high dose arnica supplement, super high dose. Within two days, my hearing comes back completely. And this isn't like made up in my head. I had gotten my hearing tested. I had 2% hearing left. Went back to the doctors, got it retested up to 89, 90% hearing. So this really happened. It was documented. And from there I became a huge believer in supplements. I was obsessed with supplements. I spent all my time researching supplements. I worked at GNC, taking 50, 100 supplements a day sometimes, just absolutely obsessed with supplements. So when I started Physician's Choice, I came up with the idea, hey, I want to start a supplement company with the highest quality supplements, efficacious supplements, high doses that I would take myself or I would recommend to my parents, my family members, supplements I would actually use, things I really believed in. And so that's what we did. And with our 60 billion probiotic, we created a highly effective product, proven strain, 60 billion CFUs. I firmly believe it's the best probiotic on the market. And there's a reason it's the number one probiotic on Amazon. We sold at Walmart, Target, CVS, 70,000 different retail distribution points. It's not by happenstance. It's because it's a great product that I take every day myself, my family takes. You know, Physician's Choice makes world-class products. I'm a true believer in all our products. I wouldn't make them. So I hope you guys take our products. I think you should give it a shot.

This was happening to me too. I was stressed and unhappy and I just felt like there was no solution to my skin. Until one day, my friends in our group chat recommended Seitu Skin Combo. Seitu Skin Combo comes with two products, the Youthful Powder and the Skin Renew Tablets. The Youthful Powder is packed with Type 1 and Type 3 marine collagen, and it's scientifically proven to rejuvenate your skin and combat signs of aging. As we age, our body loses collagen, which then leads to the fine lines, wrinkles, and just the general aging of the skin. So this powder stops that in its tracks and works its magic to take away those fine lines for good. Then comes the Skin Renew Tablets. These little beauties are powered by glutathione and vitamin C, which are both clinically proven ingredients that effectively combat dark spots and give your skin a radiant glow. These two combined mean that you can nourish your skin from within and not just from without. And what exactly makes it different? It's clinically proven to work and its method is backed by science, unlike so many other beauty products. Plus, there's no harmful chemicals, side effects, or GMO ingredients. So say goodbye to hormonal imbalances or breakouts. And they have free shipping and a 60-day money-back guarantee, which means if you use it for 59 days and see no results, you get all of your money back, no questions asked. So, if you're serious about achieving clear radiant skin and saying goodbye to those endless cycles of ineffective skincare products, Seitu Skin Combo is your answer.

This was my everyday face for the last eight months. I'm talking constant breakouts, random pimples, and nothing ever helped. I was tired of hiding behind pimple patches and using expensive skincare products that only helped for a while. My confidence was gone and I felt so self-conscious about my face. That continued for months until one night I was scrolling through TikTok and saw this video about mushroom matcha and how it apparently helps fix your acne by healing the inside. I had my doubts, but after reading the positive comments, I got myself a bag. Now everyone's not only staring at my face, they're asking for my skincare routine. And it's nothing more than a six adaptogenic mushroom and Japanese matcha blend. Mushrooms like reishi and king trumpet are natural anti-inflammatories that reduces inflammation deep in your face, supports your immune system to fight off bad bacteria, and stabilizes your hormones. Only three weeks of drinking this and I was a completely different person at my graduation. I felt so relieved seeing my pimples gradually clear up, redness reduced, and even noticed my skin became more smooth. The only downside was that a few of my friends literally got jealous of my face makeover, but that's a story for next time. Quit stressing over random pimples and breakouts and get yourself on Rise ASAP. You can try it for 30 days risk-free, so why not?", "e5e57b6c3a5240f26b6c3fd02d75d0a2.mp4": "I have some gift ideas that are for your man, but they're also kind of for yourself.

And what I saw was that like all the body washes and different things on the markets are actually detergents. We use the cold processed soap method, which means we use very high quality organic vegetable oils as our soap base. And we use process that's been around for a really long time that creates a really high quality product. And on the flip side, like most commercial soaps are formulated with cheap synthetic ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens and phthalates. So when you have a lather with that type of body wash or that type of bar soap, it's actually from like a synthetic foaming agent. But cold processed soap uses a base of natural oils. Natural oils like olive oil and coconut oil. The oil is then mixed with real ingredients like oatmeal, shea butter, sand, sea salt and natural fragrance to give its signature scent and texture. Some of the key reasons customers love our products is first and foremost, the all natural high quality ingredients. You know, they feel great. The other big pillar is just our amazing scents. So this is pine tar here. This is one of our first scents that we made. Say it's really a classic. It's just got this nice woodsy scent, a little bit of sweetness, a little bit of orange to it. You'll see it's got that nice black color, really stands out, really unique. And, you know, you can feel a little bit of that exfoliation definitely comes out more as you start to lather up with it. Here we got the cold brew cleanse. You can see the little coffee, little coffee grains in there. Smells amazing. We've got bay rum, another one of our classics, one of our first scents, wood barrel bourbon. You know, it's a little bit of like that sweet kind of whiskey cologne element to it. Very masculine, very woodsy. We've done an awesome job bringing natural scents to life in a way that kind of transports you in that shower experience and make it really enjoyable.", "e0989326775647d9be10abbacda79d9f.mp4": "Testing viral products, are they a scam?

Three and a half years ago, we opened a restaurant first in Seattle. Selfishly, we just wanted to eat our favorite foods. I'm married to Caleb, who's also my co-founder. His favorite food is something called Xinjiang bao. We had never found a good version of it here in the U.S. So for the first two weeks, it was so busy. Basically, we got things in order, but then three months after that, COVID hit. And we started to experiment with another item, which was the soup dumpling. So that's actually our e-commerce item, is frozen soup dumplings. So there were a lot of communities on Facebook that were supporting small businesses and just saying like, hey, here's this restaurant if you didn't know about it, and they're open again. That's what we leveraged. And after about a month and a half, we were open as the restaurant again. But now we had an additional line of business that we had started.", "6b25904159e358f4af31c9837c13bb02.mp4": "What's up guys, I'm Tim, I'm the founder of Broya, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about why I decided to start this brand. For years before I started Broya, I actually started sourcing high quality meats from local farmers about an hour outside of the city. You source directly from the farmer, you're getting everything. You're getting the muscle meats, the steaks, the organs, and the bones. I'm not going to lie, I had no idea what to do with these bones, so they just sat in the bottom of my freezer. Then I started doing a bit of research on bone broth, and I started to see that actually one of the best ways to get collagen protein is from bone broth. So I just started making it every single day. I started drinking about two cups every single day, and it was pretty clear to me right away that this was a game changer. Within a couple weeks, I noticed some immediate improvements in my gut health. And that's when Broya was born. Boom! I thought, man, the world needs to know about this. And there was no bone broths being sold in the grocery stores, at least no high quality ones.", "6ca8d7f98a36040e10ae797e7c437f84.mp4": "H Shirts that make you look like this?
