This AU season, if your basketball shoes feel like that because of dusty courts, we got a fix for you. We put traction in a bottle so even if you play on dusty courts like that, you got game-long grip. Just spray your shoes, wipe them dry, go hoop without slipping or sliding. One bottle is going to be good for a full season, all your games, all your practices. If you want to get some, check it out right here.
