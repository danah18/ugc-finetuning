I took a quiz to pick this candle, but it was actually so cute. I took their entire scent discovery quiz, which let them match me with my perfect scent. 99% match with pistachio dream. You know I picked pink. You know I picked pink, right? It's time to see if this is my perfect scent. Of all the candles that I've ever tried, it's either been so florally that it gives me a headache, or it smells so sweet that I wanted to throw up. P.S. the packing peanuts in your package are biodegradable. Oh, I can smell it already. This is so cute. Oh my gosh. Wow. Wow. The scent was described as pistachio cream, rose, sandalwood, and almond. Creamy, nutty, so I'm ready. If you really know your significant other or your sister or your mother or your dad, you know what scents they like. You can take the quiz for them and get a cute little candle that's handpicked for them. So yummy. Perfect balance of the floral stuff I love and the cakey, sweet stuff I love without making me feel like I'm going to throw up. I'm going to have their account tagged right here, and then you can go take the quiz in their bio. Actually so cute and fun.
