I bought these after drinking pills and people say it helps you sleep better after drinking too. I'm pretty skeptical, but I'm gonna do an experiment with this. Cheers has thousands of five-star reviews, so let's see if the hype is real. I just got home. I had four beers and usually that means I'm gonna sleep like ****. Doing it for science. 72, not the best score. Six and a half hours, just nowhere near enough. Oh my god, my heart rate was raised too. So I'm feeling pretty groggy. My anxiety is pretty bad. Queasy. Definitely not ready for the day. That water didn't do ****. Really hoping Cheers works tonight when I take it. Okay, I'm gonna run it back just like last night, but this time I'm gonna take three Cheers pills when I'm done drinking. Cheers. Sometimes you really just gotta drink four beers and make yourself a quesadilla. See you in the morning. Okay, I just woke up and I actually feel pretty damn good. All that stuff I was feeling yesterday, the brain fog, anxiety, that's all gone. Let's look at the sleep data. 92, we'll take that any day of the week. Nine hours. Love that. Ram sleep, deep sleep, heart rate is chilling. So I think the hype is real. I can't believe how good I feel right now. I feel energized and ready to take on the day. Cheers.
