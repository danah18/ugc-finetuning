I'm Nicole, I'm the founder of Splendid Spoon. I started this business when I was pregnant with my first son, Grover. I really wanted to take better care of myself. I was eating out all the time, and I realized that eating plant-based was better for my body, better for the planet, but also not really easy. And so I used my culinary skills to make food that tastes really, really good. I hope you will try.
