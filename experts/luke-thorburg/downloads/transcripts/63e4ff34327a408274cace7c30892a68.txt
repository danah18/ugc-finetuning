Bad breath doesn't come from the mouth. Let me explain. Bad breath haunted me for years and I could never figure out the cause. I always felt anxious talking to people and got super embarrassed when my friends pointed it out. I tried everything from flossing three times a day, endlessly gargling Listerine, and even using a tongue scraper. But as soon as I leave the house, my breath would smell bad again. That wasn't until I visited my doctor and he opted to do a gut microbiome test and found out that the cause of my bad breath was my imbalanced gut. I had overgrowth of bad bacteria in my gut, so no amount of Listerine helped. I started searching for solutions to heal my gut and stumbled upon a post where everyone in the comments were raving about this drink called Mushroom Matcha. I immediately ordered myself a bag and thank God I did. It's a powerful six superfood mushroom and Japanese matcha blend that helps heal your gut from the inside out. Mushrooms like reishi, turkey tail, and cordyceps work together to reduce inflammation in the gut, balance your gut microbiome, and fight off bad gut bacteria that causes bad breath. I'm only on my second week of drinking RISE and my breath feels much fresher. I can talk freely with my friends again and even food tastes better. All of this from a creamy, smooth, and delicious cup of RISE that costs just about a dollar a cup. Fixing your breath starts from your gut and I can't recommend RISE enough. Try it now with a 30-day free trial and say bye-bye to nasty breath.
