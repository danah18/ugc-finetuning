We launched this non-woke skincare brand, and the response has been insane. This is called F-Balm. This grass-fed tallow balm is an F-U to big pharma, big beauty, and the other corrupt corporations that have screwed us over. We're a non-woke, non-vegan, pro-freedom skincare company, and we're not afraid to tell the truth. We make tallow-based cosmetics that make your life better instead of worse by supporting your body and your beliefs. That means no malicious microplastics or synthetic plant-based BS that stomp on your sex drive and harass your hormones. It's time to stop supporting these big corporations that don't care about you. Our brand is built on traditional ingredients and traditional values, and we don't apologize for that. If you've had enough of the plant bases and the safe spaces, then you might be ready for the tallow truth. Hit the link below to grab your tin today.
