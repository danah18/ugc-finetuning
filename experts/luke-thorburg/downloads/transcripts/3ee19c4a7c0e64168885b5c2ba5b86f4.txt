If you're someone who likes to have a sweet treat after dinner, then this is a healthy hack for you. A month ago I started drinking sleep-inducing hot cocoa by Rise and I haven't looked back. It's the perfect combination of the sweet treat I crave every night and the best sleep I've ever gotten. Before Rise, I used to indulge in 10 to 15 grams of sugary sweets every night, resulting in terrible sleep and even worse energy the next day. This unhealthy cycle repeated itself, and I didn't realize how much these cravings were causing major disruptions in my life. But that's when I heard about Rise Hot Cocoa and decided it was worth a try. And it really works! It has ingredients like L-theanine, glycine, melatonin, and chicory, which make me knock out like a baby and get the best sleep of my life, every single night. And if you don't sleep better in 30 days, return the empty bag for a full refund. Trust me, you won't regret it. Rise is a win-win. You'll get the best sleep and satisfy your sweet tooth every single night.
