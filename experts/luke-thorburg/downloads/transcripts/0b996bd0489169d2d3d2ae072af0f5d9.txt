Today I'm showing how I can restore these chrome wheels in seconds using our mad acid. So the fastest way to clean these wheels would be to take our mad acid and spray it directly onto the wheel, let it sit for about 15-20 seconds, and then simply spray it off. But for the sake of this video, I'm going to take our mad acid and spray it directly onto a microfiber towel and I'll clean this part of the wheel. And just like that, I'm able to restore this chrome in literally seconds. So if you guys would like to try our mad acid cleaner today, click the link down below or on the bio.
