When I was a teenager, I sustained a really bad head injury. Spring break trip with some friends, a horrible head injury. I lost hearing in one of my ears, completely lost hearing, just gone. I was deaf, came back, I was going to doctor after doctor. My mom was taking me to a bunch of different doctors. One of them actually told me I needed brain surgery, but that might not fix it. It was just like horrible news after horrible news. One day she says, I want to take you to this supplement expert. At the time I was kind of like, you know, this is mumbo jumbo. I'm a 17 year old kid. I'm like, these naturopath doctors aren't real. This sounds like BS. She pushes me through, she gets me to do it, and I agree, reluctantly. So we go to this naturopath doctor and they give me this high dose arnica supplement, super high dose. Within two days, my hearing comes back completely. And this isn't like made up in my head. I had gotten my hearing tested. I had 2% hearing left. Went back to the doctors, got it retested up to 89, 90% hearing. So this really happened. It was documented. And from there I became a huge believer in supplements. I was obsessed with supplements. I spent all my time researching supplements. I worked at GNC, taking 50, 100 supplements a day sometimes, just absolutely obsessed with supplements. So when I started Physician's Choice, I came up with the idea, hey, I want to start a supplement company with the highest quality supplements, efficacious supplements, high doses that I would take myself or I would recommend to my parents, my family members, supplements I would actually use, things I really believed in. And so that's what we did. And with our 60 billion probiotic, we created a highly effective product, proven strain, 60 billion CFUs. I firmly believe it's the best probiotic on the market. And there's a reason it's the number one probiotic on Amazon. We sold at Walmart, Target, CVS, 70,000 different retail distribution points. It's not by happenstance. It's because it's a great product that I take every day myself, my family takes. You know, Physician's Choice makes world-class products. I'm a true believer in all our products. I wouldn't make them. So I hope you guys take our products. I think you should give it a shot. If you don't love it, if you don't absolutely love our product, we have a 100% money back guarantee, refund automatically, no questions asked. But I believe this product could change your life.
