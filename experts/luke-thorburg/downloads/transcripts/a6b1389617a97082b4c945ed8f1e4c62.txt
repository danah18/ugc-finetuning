Trust me, I thought matcha was healthy too until I tried this superfood blend that blew my mind. I always had trouble with my energy, brain fog, and just feeling stressed out all the time, but since drinking Rise Mushroom Matcha every morning, I feel like a new person. It's this organic superfood blend made of ceremonial grade Japanese matcha and six mushrooms and blue spirulina. It's designed to cleanse your body from the inside out. I've been taking them for a few weeks now and I have seriously noticed a huge difference in how I look and feel. My skin has cleared up, I don't crash halfway through the day like I used to, I actually wake up feeling rested, and I don't suffer from serious bloating like I used to for years. It's a really easy way to get all the essential vitamins and nutrients you need in one single scoop every day. Yeah, you need to level up your matcha game. Introduce some Rise into your life.
