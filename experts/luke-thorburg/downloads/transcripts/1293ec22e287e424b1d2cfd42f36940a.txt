The Bible mentions this vital and life-giving substance seven times, and I'm not talking about raw honey, which is mentioned 61 times. This vitamin and mineral-rich nectar has stood the test of time for thousands of years, replenishing the beauty and youthfulness of many generations. I'm referring to tallow, especially the kind derived from wild and grass-fed animals like bison. It's bioidentical to human sebum and chock-full of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K2. No man-made synthetic can ever replicate what bison tallow can do for your skin. It seeps in fast and without grease because your skin can't wait to absorb it. That's why we formulated our Grazely Tallow, harnessing the rejuvenating nature of 100% grass-fed bison suet tallow, raw manuka honey, and raw organic beeswax. A hefty 3-ounce jar lasts forever, and a tiny fingertip goes a long way. They're finally back in stock, so go check it out. You'll thank me later.
