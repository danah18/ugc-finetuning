You know when we like something, we buy it in multiple colors? That's what I did here. So I can breastfeed, it has a zipper right here. Oh, cool. But you have no idea. These will just be so useful when the baby comes. So useful, I like them. Oh, I like this color. And they have the opening too? Oh, I love that, love that color. Oh, I like every one. And you're gonna get a lot of use out of it. I'm wearing a black bra, but you can't tell, it's not a see-through material. I'm so excited about this. I like those, I think those are very versatile.
