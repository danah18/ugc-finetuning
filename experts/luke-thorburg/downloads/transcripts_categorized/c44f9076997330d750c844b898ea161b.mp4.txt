}, Questions that you guys are always asking me in my videos. Did it really help with bloating? I mean, you tell me. This was me then and this is me now. The turkey tail shiitake and king trumpet work wonders to restore your gut health and promote the growth of good bacteria in the gut. So, less inflammation and oxidative stress and better digestion. Okay, but how does it taste? It's so smooth and creamy, which is surprising considering it's pretty much 100% mushrooms. If you like coffee, you'll love the taste of rice. But do you actually like it? Like actually? No, not really. I love it. Like, is this stuff even really legal? 100%. These mushrooms are adaptogenic and not psychedelic, so they won't make you trip or feel high at all. High on life though, 100%. Does it really help with IBS or are you just saying that? I dealt with IBS for years, but thanks to the medicinal properties of these mushrooms, my gut completely fixed itself within a few weeks. Certain compounds in lion's mane and turkey tail, for example, act as prebiotics, which help support gut health and promote the growth of good bacteria as well. Give it a shot. Try rice risk-free for 30 days. You'll be thanking me later.
