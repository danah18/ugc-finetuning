}, Exercise alone will not fix this. It happens because of the weak skin, and exercising alone won't help you get rid of it. Exercise tones your muscles, but for firm skin and less cellulite, you need to target the root cause with the right nutrients. After trying almost all of the ointments, serums, and pills, I consulted a dermatologist and she recommended this skin combo by SetU. And the transformation has been insane. In the AM, I take this pill that has glutathione and vitamin C, and in the PM, I take this marine collagen. The glutathione and vitamin C boost the absorption of the marine collagen, which improves skin elasticity and strengthens connective tissues, making cellulite less noticeable. At first, I was skeptical about all the great reviews I read, but now I totally get why people love it and why dermatologists recommend it. I can finally wear all the cute tops and shorts without feeling self-conscious.
