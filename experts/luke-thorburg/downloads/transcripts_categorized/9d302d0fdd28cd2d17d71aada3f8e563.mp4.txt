}, Why 30-year-olds love this shirt. True Classic has changed the T-shirt game. They have created a shirt for the everyman. Designed to be tighter around your arms, chest, and shoulders, which means you see more muscles and less belly. Fit is just, it's perfect. It's form-fitting, soft. I've tried other brand shirts and nothing fits like a True Classic. I'm actually about to throw out the rest of the T-shirts that I've got in my closet and replace them with all these, man.
