}, Why was I paying $25 at CVS when it's way cheaper to get it from Harry's? Just delivered to me online. Saving a few bucks on something that I do almost every day? Yeah, I'll save those few bucks. Thank you very much. Oh man, this is incredible. It's so smooth, man. This was a premium experience. Wow, this thing cuts nice. This is such an upgrade from what I was using before. It just comes right off. The Harry's razor really works. Honestly, it feels as sharp as the day that I unboxed it. Wow, look at that. Won't even have to go back over that again. You can get Harry's trial set for just $5. It's a no-brainer. Go check them out. Go try Harry's. I don't know what you're waiting for.
