}, I tried this viral skin combo for my pigmentation and here's what happened. This was me literally three weeks ago. Now the pigmentation has reduced. Buying Seytoo's skin combo was the best decision I ever made. It repaired my skin literally from the inside out and warded the dullness, the pigmentation, and the crow's feet under my eyes. Seytoo's skin combo works on the entire body. Marine collagen is really great for your bones, your nails, and your hair, while glutathione fights free radicals in your body. I was a little skeptical before purchasing, but oh boy, it was so worth every single dime. I can finally wear all the tank tops and shorts without feeling self-conscious. I've never felt more confident in my skin. And since I couldn't lose the cellulite with exercise, these have become my saviors.
