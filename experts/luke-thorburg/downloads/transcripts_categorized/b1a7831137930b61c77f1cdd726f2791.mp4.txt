}, Oh no, we didn't. Cherry flavor is here and this flavor tastes f***ing amazing. You won't believe it powerfully cleans your teeth. I can't lie, I'm snacking on this flavor as I'm writing this ad because it tastes so damn good. I won't be surprised if this flavor starts getting sold on the street for ten times the price. Believe me babe, this will sell quick so you might want to stock up before it's too late.
