}, Taking all my supplements is hard to remember, not to mention expensive. Here's what I did. I used to spend $15 to $30 per bottle. Now multiply that times five and you can only imagine the damage. So I made the switch to Rise Mushroom Coffee. I was never a fan of adding pills and supplements to my diet, so it's so hard to find products that aren't full of toxic fillers. But Rise is 100% organic and loaded with six powerful adaptogenic mushrooms, cordyceps, reishi, lion's mane, shiitake, king trumpet, and turkey tail. Every scoop is packed with antioxidants and nutrients that help with bloating and gut issues, improve sleep quality and reduce stress, boost focus, and improve physical stamina, just to name a few. All these benefits in one single cup. On top of that, Rise is vegan-friendly, gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy-free, and keto-friendly, so literally anyone can enjoy the benefits. Being healthy just got so much easier and more convenient now that I'm getting all the nutrients I used to get from my supplements, if not more, for a fraction of the cost. Rise is literally $1 a cup. Get yourself some Rise Mushroom Coffee. I regret not making the switch earlier.
