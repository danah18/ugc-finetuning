  "product_description": "A skincare line made from high-quality beef tallow sourced from the family’s own cattle, designed to nourish, hydrate, and soothe the skin naturally. The products focus on using simple, natural ingredients rich in vitamins and nutrients, providing deep hydration and supporting a healthy complexion by mimicking the skin’s own oils."
}, We don't believe that vegan skincare filled with ingredients you can't pronounce is a flex. We prefer to do it the natural way, the same way that people have been keeping their skin healthy and radiant for thousands of years. We use only the highest quality tallow that comes from cattle our family raises. Our rule is if it's not something we would put on our own family, then we don't sell it. Beef tallow is a natural moisturizer packed with vitamins and nutrients known to nourish, hydrate, and soothe for a healthy, balanced complexion. Tallow mirrors your skin's natural oils, locking in deep hydration and mimicking its barrier, all while nourishing with vitamins for a healthy, radiant glow. Don't believe the lie that for your skincare to work, it has to be loaded with ingredients you can't pronounce. We've got thousands of customers who have made the switch to our tallow skincare and never looked back. Head to our website and get 10% off your first order with code PURE10.
