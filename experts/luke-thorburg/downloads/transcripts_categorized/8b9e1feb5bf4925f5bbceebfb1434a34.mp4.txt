}, Does edge spray work on dirty courts? Yes, it absolutely does, and here's how. So you've probably seen these sticky pads before. This is what I grew up using. You step on them, and the adhesive pulls any dirt or anything off the bottom of your shoe. The problem with these are, the effects only last a couple of seconds, and the adhesive that they actually use sticks to the bottom of your shoe, picking up even more dust when you start playing again. So what edge spray is, is basically like traction in a bottle. They got a bunch of smart people together and invented a formula that bonds with the rubber of your shoe. It instantly increases your grip on the court and counters dust from getting on your shoe in the first place. All you do is spray it twice like this, wait a few seconds, kick the ground, then you'll have grip that lasts the whole game. And don't worry, sneakerheads, it's perfectly safe for your soles and actually extends the life of your shoes. No one likes getting their ankles broken, so check out edge spray. It's what professional athletes and Olympians are using on their shoes, and you should too.
