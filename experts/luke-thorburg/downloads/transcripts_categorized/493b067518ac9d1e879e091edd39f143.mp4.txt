}, Warning: Don't wear this if you don't like women flirting with you. I was in line and smelled the most irresistible cologne that I've ever smelt. I gave in and asked him what he was wearing. He said it was Cupid's Hypnosis. Apparently, it's infused with pheromones that makes women crave you. He couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it before. This cologne is the real deal. So I asked him to send me the link so I could order a bottle for my boyfriend. Now I can't keep my hands off him.
