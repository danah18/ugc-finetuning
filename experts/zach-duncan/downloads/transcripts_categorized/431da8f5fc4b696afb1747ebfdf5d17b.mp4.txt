Dr. Squatch, natural bar soap for men with exfoliants and distinctive scents, Why women are attracted to this soap. My boyfriend would cheap out on his junk by smearing this body wash all over. So I found Dr. Squatch's soap that literally smells like the perfect man. The great thing about it is that there's real exfoliants built right in. You can see them all over the bar. Pine tar is his favorite because it smells rugged, and I love bay rum because it makes him smell like a tropical escape. His skin has never felt this soft and clean, plus he smells so sexy. Switch over to Dr. Squatch to see why women are obsessed.
