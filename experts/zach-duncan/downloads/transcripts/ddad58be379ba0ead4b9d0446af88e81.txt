90% of people who take Alix in a clinical trial saw a reduction in PMS symptoms. My hormones didn't just affect me when I was on my period. Between the migraines and cramps when I was actually bleeding, I also had month-long acne and I just generally felt really moody and tired all the time. So I decided to give Alix a try. Alix is a completely natural blend full of herbs and botanicals that is custom to my body. All I had to do was take a quick 10-minute quiz to go over my month-long menstrual history and they actually showed the herbs that were going to be in my formula and why. For instance, for my blend there is angelica sinensis which is used for my cramps and my migraines. To discover your herbal blend, go take the 10-minute quiz and then tell someone who has periods.
