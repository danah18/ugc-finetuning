I thought I had good hygiene until she told me. Stop putting harsh chemicals on your junk. So my girlfriend sent me all these articles about toxic chemicals being in my body wash. I mean some of these ingredients are banned in Europe. So I did some research and this pine tar soap from Dr. Squatch popped up. Apparently it's specifically made for men. It's full of healthy ingredients like shea butter, sea salt, oh and actual chunks of oatmeal to help clean off all the dirt clogging my pores. And you guys, the entire bathroom smelled like fresh pine trees. After just like one or two showers, I could feel a difference. So could my girlfriend because, well alright, you get it. Hands down pine tar is the best man. I don't know what your favorite is but this one's been working for me like a charm. You gotta get it.
