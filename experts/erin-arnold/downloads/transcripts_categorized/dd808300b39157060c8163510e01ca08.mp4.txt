}, Is Sundays for Dogs worth the hype? Let's find out. As a dog mom of 10 years, I've always been conscious of what goes into my dog's food, but it's hard to find the time to deal with fresh or frozen dog food. So when I heard Sundays for Dogs is a healthy scoop and serve dog food, I knew I needed to try it out. It's not only 100% human grade, but also over 83% meat, zero synthetic additives, and it has ingredients you can actually read like flaxseed, parsley, and turmeric. It uses an air drying method that preserves nutrients and flavor. I gave it to my dogs and they were obsessed with the jerky-like texture. Since giving it to them, I've noticed shinier fur, better smelling breath, way more energy, they're less itchy, and basically acting like puppies again. Feeding is so easy, I can take it from bag to bowl in no time. And I love seeing how excited my dogs get when I'm about to serve it to them. If you're looking for a healthy, easy dog food alternative, you need Sundays.
