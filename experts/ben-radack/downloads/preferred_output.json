No matter how much sleep you get, simple everyday tasks feel exhausting. I personally had all three of these problems and felt miserable. I tried digestive enzymes, high fiber diets, and even probiotics, but barely saw any difference. I wanted to heal my gut so badly and spent an embarrassing amount of time digging for solutions. And I'm so glad that I went to my nutritionist because she recommended an unheard of gut healing drink.

Having too much estrogen literally can cause men to have man boobs and even lead to infertility. That's the main reason why I started drinking this mushroom matcha drink, which I saw on Facebook. It's packed with matcha and six powerful adaptogenic mushrooms. Antioxidants support your liver health, helping to break down and reduce estrogen levels and as a result, increasing testosterone.
