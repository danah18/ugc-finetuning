}, Three signs your gut is inflamed. One, constant bloating, and no diet, fiber, or prebiotic drink seems to help. Two, excessive farting. Pulling farts in public and stomach rumbling is becoming a daily thing. Three, endless fatigue. No matter how much sleep you get, simple everyday tasks feel exhausting. I personally had all three of these problems and felt miserable. I tried digestive enzymes, high fiber diets, and even probiotics, but barely saw any difference. I wanted to heal my gut so badly and spent an embarrassing amount of time digging for solutions. And I'm so glad that I went to my nutritionist because she recommended an unheard of gut healing drink. It's a powerful blend of six adaptogenic mushrooms that work together to balance your gut microbiome and heal it from the inside. You have king trumpet and shiitake to reduce gut inflammation, turkey tail and reishi to balance your digestive system and reduce fatigue, and lion's mane and cordyceps to promote focus and boost your energy. All of that in one single scoop of Rise. After a few months, my bloating issues were almost completely gone. Unexpected farts are no longer bothering me and I have energy all day. Thousands of people have switched over to Rise and it's pretty clear why. The benefits are endless. Try it now, risk free for 30 days and you'll see what I mean.
