}, This functional mocktail makes me feel like a social powerhouse. The key ingredient is this feel-free tonic made with kava. This stuff boosts my mood, gives me more energy without a crash, and clears my mind so that I'm not overthinking all night. I feel like I've had a few drinks without the hangover the next morning. It's made from natural ingredients like kava, lion's mane, cola nut, and rhodiola. The pineapple and coconut cream in this mocktail add a nice touch to the kava tonic, but I also love taking it on its own as a shot. Comes with me everywhere, and I always have one on hand. They've been selling out fast, so check them out while you can. Happy sipping!
