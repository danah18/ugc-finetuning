}, Things I wish I invested in my 20s? Taking collagen. After the age of 20, your body stops producing collagen, so you start dealing with wrinkles, dry skin, age spots. Then I found Avi, which helped improve the appearance of my skin. Not only does it have collagen, but also hyaluronic acid, which is the best duo for healthy skin and beauty. I am so happy with the results. Don't wait until it's too late, so start taking Avi today.
