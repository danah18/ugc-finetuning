I feel like I've been shaving wrong my entire life! No matter what I try, I always get razor bumps when I shave the little kitty cat. My best friend told me about Truly. Truly's shaving set will change the way you shave. This is the Smooth Legends pre-shave scrub, so you want to lather it on right before you shave. This is an exfoliant so it removes dead skin cells and helps to soften the hair so that the razors can get really close, giving you an incredible close shave. This Happy Hairless Shave Butter has amazing ingredients like coconut oil, lavender, and passion fruit, which make the perfect shaving companion. This is going to support the skin barrier for healthier skin. So pretty! This razor is so cute! The magnetic razor head is a game changer. They're infused with aloe and shea butter so it really helps the razor just glide. This helps reduce ingrown hairs and razor bumps, leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth. This is what makes my skin hydrate and glow. The new Smooth Legends Complete Set comes with so many amazing products. I don't think my bikini line has ever felt this soft after shaving.
