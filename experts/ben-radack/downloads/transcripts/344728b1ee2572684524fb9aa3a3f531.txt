What is the best thing about this and why this is different than all of the other ones that you see on the market is this targets your colon, which is amazing. It just goes straight to work. I recommend Ritual Symbiotic Plus. It has digestive support, gut support, immune support, and gut lining fuel. It's a prebiotic, probiotic, and postbiotic all in one. The prebiotic targets unwanted bacteria in your gut. Probiotic supplies good bacteria to your gut. And then the postbiotic provides fuel to your gut lining. So this is the perfect all in one. Another thing I love about the Ritual Symbiotic Plus is that it has a delayed release capsule. So this little capsule is actually designed to reach your colon, which is the ideal place for a probiotics to live. So if you're going to take a supplement, this is definitely my favorite one to take. So if you're like me and you're stressed out and it's really messed up with your gut or you're just looking to have better habits in general, I definitely recommend.
