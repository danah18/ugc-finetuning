I think one of the hardest things about becoming a new mom is all of the different products that you need to research. One product that I no longer have to research is my Ritual prenatals. I used the Ritual prenatal through my entire pregnancy and I loved it. The prenatal has 12 key nutrients for pregnancy and they have a delayed release capsule designed to be gentle on the stomach. So if you're a nauseous mama, this is going to be a lot better for you because you can eat it on an empty stomach. She's a Ritual community, and as you can see, she is just a gem. If you're thinking about trying to conceive, you're pregnant, or you're postpartum, I recommend Ritual. Give your body and your baby what they need with Ritual.
