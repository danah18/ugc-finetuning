I've been waiting for this day. I'm trying out my new nutter machine. With this, I can quickly and easily make my own homemade plant milks. Which is great because there are some delicious plant milks at the store, but if you've ever looked at the ingredients list, it's scary. So many additives. What? Oh my god! Okay, that was one of the easiest things I've ever done and this milk is delicious. It's so creamy. And even more so because I know exactly what's in it. This makes single servings. I wish it was like this big, but this is amazing. I'm really happy I have this nutter machine now. This is going to change the way we drink milk.
