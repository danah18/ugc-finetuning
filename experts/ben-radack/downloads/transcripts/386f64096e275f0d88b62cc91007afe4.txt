I guarantee this will get rid of your strawberry legs or you get your money back. First, I go in with this moonrock scrub all over to exfoliate away any hard bumps on the skin. Then I follow it up with this super powerful plant collagen polish to plump up and renew. This is basically like a time machine for your skin. Follow that up with a niacinamide serum to shrink your pores and then after all that oil stripping, the shea butter based moisturizer is a must for conditioning. This is my holy grail routine and I am so sticking by it.
