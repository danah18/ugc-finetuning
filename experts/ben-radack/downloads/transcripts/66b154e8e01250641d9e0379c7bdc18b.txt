Ah yes, the forbidden formula. The impact of this gloss is mind-blowing. I'll apply it to just half of the teeth. You'll see why. Truly remarkable. The gloss stick uses an advanced pearlescent brightening technology proprietary to HiSmile. It can brighten any stain, whether it's coffee, wine, and more. The gloss stick can be used outside of clinical settings. This prestigious product can be paired with this Fluoride Plus toothpaste in this bundle. The best part is any of these flavoured toothpastes cost less than a dollar in the bundle. It might not be sold out just yet. Go see.
