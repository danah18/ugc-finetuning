Tracking my ovulation felt like a guessing game. I was getting positive results three times a month because of multiple LH surges. Then I started tracking with Inito and it took all the guesswork out. Inito measures and analyzes all fertility hormones incredibly accurately in one strip. Inito shows actual values whereas ovulation tests show just a yes or no. And it personalizes all your results into super clear hormone charts. You can see in this chart that my LH levels rose three times, but this was my highest. And Inito confirmed the correct surge because my PDG rose here, which means I ovulated. It's so much clearer and way more accurate. I can't believe I spent all this time reading lines. So if you're trying to conceive, trust me, get Inito.
