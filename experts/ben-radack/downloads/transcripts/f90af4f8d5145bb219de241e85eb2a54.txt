How to be a social butterfly without alcohol part 2: my secret weapon. If you haven't tried this Feel Free Wellness Tonic, it's an all-natural and powerful way to feel more social without a hangover and more energetic and focused without jitters. I love to take this when I want to feel absolutely magnetic at parties or when I need to work a room, nail a presentation, or just crush my to-do list. It's made with potent botanicals and adaptogens like kava, which is an ancient ceremonial plant that helps you feel more relaxed and boost your mood, lion's mane, the ultimate smart mushroom that improves brain function, and other ingredients like kola nut for some natural caffeine without a crash, and rhodiola to help you be more resilient to occasional stress. It comes in a 12-pack and works out to about $6 per serving or $4 if you subscribe, which is certified worth it for me. So discover the magic of kava before it sells out again.
