Bro, I have a date tonight. My skin is breaking out. Has no one told you about Dermatica? No, man. I don't really trust online skincare. It's so expensive and confusing. Dermatica is completely different. They have a dermatology team that selects a prescription formula for your skin's problems. Oh, it's like getting skincare from the pharmacy? Exactly. They use the same effective ingredients and they have regular check-ins with you too. Okay, but it still must be like hundreds of dollars, right? Nope. It's super affordable and easy to set up. Just go on their website and get a free consultation. Oh, so a free consultation? It's that easy? They'll prescribe you skincare that reduces stuff like breakouts, hyperpigmentation, textured skin, wrinkles, and more. So why haven't I heard about them before? I don't know, man, but they have thousands of five-star reviews. So stop using hand soap on your face and try Dermatica.
