This is the craziest thing I've seen all year. This is basically an HDMI hard drive that stores 15,000 retro games on it. As soon as you plug it into the TV, it's instantly ready. It not only comes with one remote, but two. There's like five different versions of Mario, but we can all agree that number one's the best. I was never too good at Street Fighter, but this one's fun. And Pac-Man, this is my all-time favorite. And that's obviously not it. There's like Mortal Kombat, Tetris, etc. And there's 15,000 different options. The fun is never going to end.
