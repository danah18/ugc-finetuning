Gordon Ramsay was not lying when he said these are the Rolls Royce of pans. There's no other pans like these. These hex clad pans are non-toxic, which I love. They're super non-stick and so easy to clean. They're oven safe up to 500 degrees, they're dishwasher safe, and they're safe to use with any metal utensils. So save yourself the hassle and invest in cookware that actually works.
