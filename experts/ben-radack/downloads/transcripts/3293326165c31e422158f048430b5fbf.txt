Three signs that your testosterone has taken a hit. One, zero motivation to do anything. Two, constant brain fog and struggling to do anything clearly. Three, slow muscle and strength growth. Not too long ago, this was my daily life and it sucked. I visited a doctor and it turns out my liver wasn't functioning optimally, making my body store excessive amounts of the female hormone estrogen. Having too much estrogen literally can cause men to have man boobs and even lead to infertility. That's the main reason why I started drinking this mushroom matcha drink, which I saw on Facebook. It's packed with matcha and six powerful adaptogenic mushrooms. Antioxidants support your liver health, helping to break down and reduce estrogen levels and as a result, increasing testosterone. Unlike the shady test boosters I've tried in the past, this stuff actually works because it attacks the root of the problem. Three weeks of drinking it each morning and funny to say, but I'm starting to feel like a man again. I have long lasting energy throughout my days. My mental clarity has returned. I've been making visible progress in the gym and I noticed that I'm just more motivated to work on myself. Guys, it may not be a beer, but it's damn delicious and healthy for you. My advice, don't bother with test boosters and go for a proven all natural solution. Try Rise right now for 30 days risk-free and bring your T-levels back to life.
