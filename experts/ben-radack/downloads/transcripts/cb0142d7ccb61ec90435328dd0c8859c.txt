Mmm, so delicious. Oh wow, this is really good. This is the night drink by 10pm. It helps you fall asleep and stay asleep and it literally melts away anxiety and stress. I honestly didn't think this was going to work. I was like, what can a hot chocolate actually do? But it's amazing. It calms down my mind and my body. It's filled with amazing natural ingredients like magnesium and zinc that actually help you fall asleep. There's nothing habit forming or artificial. It's just these natural ingredients that really do work. It's vegan, gluten free, really low in sugar and only 24 calories. It really calms down the mind and body and melts away anxiety and stress. I love it.
