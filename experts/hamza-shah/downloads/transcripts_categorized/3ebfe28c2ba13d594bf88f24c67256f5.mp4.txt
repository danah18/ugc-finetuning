}, What do you look for in a deodorant when you're shopping out there? If it's aluminum-free, it's my biggest thing. I heard that's a big thing. I like stuff that doesn't leave a stain on my shirts. So usually I use chalk deodorant. Yeah, that leaves big old stains. I get itchy with the chalk ones, so I have to use the clear ones. Bravo Sierra has the best deodorants I've ever used. Ever. My favorite is the white vetiver and cedarwood. That's a good one. I also have the same flavor in soap. I think it's a scent. Flavor is funny. It's the best product that I've ever used. I've gotten so many compliments.
