}, I mean, they're in my bed, and I had one, and I put it on the ground, and Pat, look how Mona just went over to it. My dog is curled up on the Blissey pillowcase. Look, and she fell right asleep. I don't know, there's no other way to show how incredible this pillowcase is. To me, this is just like, you know, you can't say a dog's full of shit. Like, dogs don't care. She's not getting paid for this. Like, this is the best endorsement on the planet.
