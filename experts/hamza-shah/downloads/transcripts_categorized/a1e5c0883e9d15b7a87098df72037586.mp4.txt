  "product_description": "A dietary supplement made from organ meats, specifically targeted to women, designed to provide nutrients that support women's health and help with issues like inflammation, bloating, and general wellbeing. The product is inspired by ancestral diets where the whole animal, including organs such as liver and uterus, was consumed for its health benefits."
}, I went through some time after college struggling with diet, inflammation, bloating, and I never knew what it was. I finally started digging deeper, tracing it back to our ancestors. They were eating the entire cow, like everything. I was amazed, like I can't believe liver and uterus have all these benefits. Finding out that organ meats were like pound for pound better than grains or other supplements I was taking, that really gave me inspiration to want to create something that could be easier for women to take, giving them the nutrients that is just for women to help them with their day-to-day struggles, their personal problems.
