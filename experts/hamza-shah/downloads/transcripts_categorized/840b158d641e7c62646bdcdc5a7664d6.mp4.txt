  "brand_name": "Javi",
  "product_description": "Javi is an eco-conscious coffee concentrate that comes in a glass bottle, offering a sustainable alternative to single-use coffee pods and plastic cups. It provides 30 servings per bottle, supports regenerative agriculture, and allows users to make coffee at home with minimal waste."
}, Three reasons why big chain coffee shops have cut the earth's life in half. Reason number one, K-Cups waste has become such a big problem that it can wrap around the planet more than 10 times. Eco-conscious coffee drinkers are switching to Javi because it uses glass bottles. Reason number two, Starbucks uses more than 8,000 plastic cups per minute. The easiest way to reduce that is by making coffee at home with reusable cups. Javi comes with 30 servings in one glass bottle. So ditching single-use plastic has never been easier. And reason number three, last but certainly not least, coffee production is destroying the world's ecosystem. Coffee companies now more than ever need to be focused on regenerative agriculture. Javi is committed to building the future of regenerative agriculture based on coffee and pays a premium to support regenerative efforts. Tasty coffee is finally convenient, affordable, and eco-conscious with Javi. And here's a huge bonus. You can lock in a free Javi today. Only if you act now. Cheers!
