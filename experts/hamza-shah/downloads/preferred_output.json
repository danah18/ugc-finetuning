I like stuff that doesn't leave a stain on my shirts. So usually I use chalk deodorant. Yeah, that leaves big old stains. I get itchy with the chalk ones, so I have to use the clear ones. Bravo Sierra has the best deodorants I've ever used. Ever. My favorite is the white vetiver and cedarwood. That's a good one. I also have the same flavor in soap. I think it's a scent. Flavor is funny. It's the best product that I've ever used.

I finally started digging deeper, tracing it back to our ancestors. They were eating the entire cow, like everything. I was amazed, like I can't believe liver and uterus have all these benefits. Finding out that organ meats were like pound for pound better than grains or other supplements I was taking, that really gave me inspiration to want to create something that could be easier for women to take, giving them the nutrients that is just for women to help them with their day-to-day struggles, their personal problems.", "463945688e82622a3f25bc8402320b65.mp4": "I'm gonna show you the most amazing gift.

They've created almost a reality TV show in their social content. Like instead of creating a lot of content, like celebrating the product, they focus on the storytelling.

Your mouth is home to billions of microscopic germs, bacteria, and even fungi. Well, they stick to your teeth, they get hard and stay in your mouth even after you brush your teeth and use mouthwash. And the germs inside your plaque can create sulfur, the nasty chemical that gives rotten eggs their signature smell. And here's an interesting study I found. They say that yellow teeth make you look about 10 to 13 years old. Now, you can't just brush it off. Once those germs get hard and turn into tartar, they stuck on no matter how hard you brush or how often you use mouthwash. Dr. Ganz, she's a dentist, she explained that hardened tartar is impossible to brush off. You need a serious tool like they have at the dentist's office. Or you can do something else at home. 12,000, that's the magic number. We're going to get back to that soon. Now, you probably don't have $5,000 to buy a bunch of dental equipment. I know I don't. So instead, I'm going to tell you about this thing I've been using. It's called the Plaque Blaster from this company called Swiss Click. They basically took the design of those professional dental machines and shrank it down to a handheld device. It's really light, easy to use. You just turn it on and it starts vibrating and you go ahead and take the ugly yellow junk right off your teeth. Now, thankfully, this podcast doesn't have smell-o-vision because before, I had really bad breath. I mean, I tried everything, mints, gum, mouthwash, whatever. I even used those little mouthwash strips. I was basically addicted, but my breath was just awful. And my grandkids let me know every time they saw me. Now, I use this thing just a few minutes a day and the plaque and tartar and all those hard, nasty smelling germs are just gone. It also works on dentures. It works with braces. It even works if you have sensitive teeth. I'm telling you, I can't even eat ice cream, but this thing does not bother me at all. So let's get back to that magic number, 12,000. That's how many times this thing vibrates in a minute. And that's the perfect speed to vibrate and shake off your plaque and tartar without damaging your teeth or causing sore gums. It's that sweet spot where you kill the tartar without hurting your teeth. There's like 10,000, let me see, 10,503 customers. They give it a 4.9 star rating. People love this thing and it does have a money back guarantee. Safe as purchase. Try it out. Trust me, you will love this thing. I feel weird for loving a plaque scraper so much, but having fresh breath and white teeth is just a big relief for me. Try it out. Let me know what you think, guys.", "840b158d641e7c62646bdcdc5a7664d6.mp4": "Three reasons why big chain coffee shops have cut the earth's life in half. Reason number one, K-Cups waste has become such a big problem that it can wrap around the planet more than 10 times. Eco-conscious coffee drinkers are switching to Javi because it uses glass bottles. Reason number two, Starbucks uses more than 8,000 plastic cups per minute. The easiest way to reduce that is by making coffee at home with reusable cups. Javi comes with 30 servings in one glass bottle. So ditching single-use plastic has never been easier. And reason number three, last but certainly not least, coffee production is destroying the world's ecosystem. Coffee companies now more than ever need to be focused on regenerative agriculture. Javi is committed to building the future of regenerative agriculture based on coffee and pays a premium to support regenerative efforts. Tasty coffee is finally convenient, affordable, and eco-conscious with Javi. And here's a huge bonus. You can lock in a free Javi today. Only if you act now.

A recent report exposed that 58 out of 100 workout supplements contained at least one proprietary blend. This means a company can list an ingredient on the label and not have to disclose how much of that ingredient is in the supplement, meaning it's not transparent. And you can actually still get away with this, and I think it needs to be addressed. Because you could be wasting your hard-earned money on workout supplements that are severely underdosed and aren't going to help you see faster results in the gym. And I think it's time for all supplement companies to be fully transparent with their formulas. When it comes to non-transparent pre-workout formulas, the supplement companies are potentially profiting way more at the expense of you crashing and having terrible workouts because you're basically just taking flavored caffeine. Look, I'm the co-founder of Alpha Lion, and one of our values has always been transparency. In fact, transparency in the supplement industry used to be so much worse, which is one of the main reasons we started Alpha Lion in the first place. Whether you buy Alpha Lion or any other supplement company you trust, my main goal for you today is simply never buy a non-transparent supplement again. Over a million gym enthusiasts trust Superhuman Pre-Workout. It's the fully transparent pre-workout collection with long-lasting energy, irresistible flavors, and superhuman performance. And best of all, there's a clinically dosed Superhuman for every caffeine tolerance. Alpha Lion doesn't take a one-size-fits-all approach like other brands. Find the Superhuman Pre that's perfect for you below and experience what a transparent pre-workout really feels like in the gym.", "0af3011f232cec25e9845724a690ff2c.mp4": "I mean, they're in my bed, and I had one, and I put it on the ground, and Pat, look how Mona just went over to it.
