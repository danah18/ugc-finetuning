Here's why you should flush your workout supplements down the toilet. A recent report exposed that 58 out of 100 workout supplements contained at least one proprietary blend. This means a company can list an ingredient on the label and not have to disclose how much of that ingredient is in the supplement, meaning it's not transparent. And you can actually still get away with this, and I think it needs to be addressed. Because you could be wasting your hard-earned money on workout supplements that are severely underdosed and aren't going to help you see faster results in the gym. And I think it's time for all supplement companies to be fully transparent with their formulas. When it comes to non-transparent pre-workout formulas, the supplement companies are potentially profiting way more at the expense of you crashing and having terrible workouts because you're basically just taking flavored caffeine. Look, I'm the co-founder of Alpha Lion, and one of our values has always been transparency. In fact, transparency in the supplement industry used to be so much worse, which is one of the main reasons we started Alpha Lion in the first place. Whether you buy Alpha Lion or any other supplement company you trust, my main goal for you today is simply never buy a non-transparent supplement again. Over a million gym enthusiasts trust Superhuman Pre-Workout. It's the fully transparent pre-workout collection with long-lasting energy, irresistible flavors, and superhuman performance. And best of all, there's a clinically dosed Superhuman for every caffeine tolerance. Alpha Lion doesn't take a one-size-fits-all approach like other brands. Find the Superhuman Pre that's perfect for you below and experience what a transparent pre-workout really feels like in the gym.
