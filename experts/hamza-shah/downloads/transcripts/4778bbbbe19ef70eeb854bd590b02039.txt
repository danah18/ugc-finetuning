A lot of people don't realize that face wash and masks and skincare don't help hormonal acne. You have to address that issue from the inside and balance your hormones. And I've tried it all, and Flo is what finally worked for me. Waking up in the morning after getting my period and not having hormonal acne was the craziest experience of my life. I experienced it for years, and it was just so incredible to wake up with clear skin. It felt amazing. The world needs to know about Flo. I really encourage every woman to try Flo. If you're struggling with hormonal acne or bloating and cramps, it's just such a revolutionary product, and it helps from the inside out, and that's amazing.
