This is what the water you're using to wash your face and your body is going through. That's disgusting. Did you know tap water contains heavy metals and chlorine that dry and damage the skin, leaving your efforts and money on skincare go to waste? Use a filter baby water filter and remove those harsh contaminants. My skin is so smooth and soft after just two weeks, and it feels good knowing I'm addressing the root cause of my issues. This simple switch makes such a big difference.
