That's a great question. Your mouth is home to billions of microscopic germs, bacteria, and even fungi. Well, they stick to your teeth, they get hard and stay in your mouth even after you brush your teeth and use mouthwash. And the germs inside your plaque can create sulfur, the nasty chemical that gives rotten eggs their signature smell. And here's an interesting study I found. They say that yellow teeth make you look about 10 to 13 years old. Now, you can't just brush it off. Once those germs get hard and turn into tartar, they stuck on no matter how hard you brush or how often you use mouthwash. Dr. Ganz, she's a dentist, she explained that hardened tartar is impossible to brush off. You need a serious tool like they have at the dentist's office. Or you can do something else at home. 12,000, that's the magic number. We're going to get back to that soon. Now, you probably don't have $5,000 to buy a bunch of dental equipment. I know I don't. So instead, I'm going to tell you about this thing I've been using. It's called the Plaque Blaster from this company called Swiss Click. They basically took the design of those professional dental machines and shrank it down to a handheld device. It's really light, easy to use. You just turn it on and it starts vibrating and you go ahead and take the ugly yellow junk right off your teeth. Now, thankfully, this podcast doesn't have smell-o-vision because before, I had really bad breath. I mean, I tried everything, mints, gum, mouthwash, whatever. I even used those little mouthwash strips. I was basically addicted, but my breath was just awful. And my grandkids let me know every time they saw me. Now, I use this thing just a few minutes a day and the plaque and tartar and all those hard, nasty smelling germs are just gone. It also works on dentures. It works with braces. It even works if you have sensitive teeth. I'm telling you, I can't even eat ice cream, but this thing does not bother me at all. So let's get back to that magic number, 12,000. That's how many times this thing vibrates in a minute. And that's the perfect speed to vibrate and shake off your plaque and tartar without damaging your teeth or causing sore gums. It's that sweet spot where you kill the tartar without hurting your teeth. There's like 10,000, let me see, 10,503 customers. They give it a 4.9 star rating. People love this thing and it does have a money back guarantee. Safe as purchase. Try it out. Trust me, you will love this thing. I feel weird for loving a plaque scraper so much, but having fresh breath and white teeth is just a big relief for me. Try it out.

A recent report exposed that 58 out of 100 workout supplements contained at least one proprietary blend. This means a company can list an ingredient on the label and not have to disclose how much of that ingredient is in the supplement, meaning it's not transparent. And you can actually still get away with this, and I think it needs to be addressed. Because you could be wasting your hard-earned money on workout supplements that are severely underdosed and aren't going to help you see faster results in the gym. And I think it's time for all supplement companies to be fully transparent with their formulas. When it comes to non-transparent pre-workout formulas, the supplement companies are potentially profiting way more at the expense of you crashing and having terrible workouts because you're basically just taking flavored caffeine. Look, I'm the co-founder of Alpha Lion, and one of our values has always been transparency. In fact, transparency in the supplement industry used to be so much worse, which is one of the main reasons we started Alpha Lion in the first place.
