The concert hack I tell all my friends about. I consider myself an avid concert goer, but I'm only able to go as often as I do because I wear these. The constant ringing in my ears following the concert used to ruin my day. But since wearing Loop Experience Plus earplugs to every show, it's a whole new world for me. They use an acoustic channel and mesh to filter noise, and don't worry, you can still hear the music so clearly, just at a lower volume. They even come with this mute accessory that adds an extra five decibels of noise reduction for when the band just gets extra loud. They're reusable, they're effective, and they're stunning. Check them out for yourself at loopearplugs.com.
