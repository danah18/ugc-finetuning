Gift ideas for the person that's impossible to gift for. I never know what to get my dad during the holidays, but I got him a BlendJet and now he uses it daily. It's compact and tiny to replace that big bulky blender on his kitchen counter, and it comes in a bunch of colors to match anyone's vibe. It blends anything in seconds and it's self-cleaning, making his life so much easier. He clearly loves it and sends me pictures of new recipes he makes with it all the time. I'm telling you, check out blendjet.com for your gifts.
