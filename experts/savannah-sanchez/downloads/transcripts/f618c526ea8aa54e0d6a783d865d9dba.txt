Finding the best gear for snowboarding season used to be stressful and overwhelming until I found this website. Curated.com has been a lifesaver for me. I took their online questionnaire that asked me what I'm looking for. It asked about my goals and my budget and my past experience, and I could even chat with a snowboarding expert to help me out. There's such a variety of gear and equipment on this website, and there's 840 snowboarding experts. There's even detailed ratings and reviews for all the products to let you know what they're good for and what they're not so good for. It seriously makes it so simple to get set up for a successful snowboarding season this year. I highly recommend Curated.
