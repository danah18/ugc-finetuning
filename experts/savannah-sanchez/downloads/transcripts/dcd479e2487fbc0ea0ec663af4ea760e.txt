I solved the shadowban on Instagram. My posts were hidden because I was buying followers and using lots of hashtags for more visibility. I found a better way to grow my page without spamming. It’s the social path. I used their AI to target my audience. My posts get lots of likes and comments. It's nice to see real followers who appreciate what I post, instead of bots flooding my page with fake numbers and dropping my engagement. The almost automatic growth is crazy and authentic. Blown away by Pat Social, I wish I had found it sooner. Easier to boost your IG account—sign up today.
