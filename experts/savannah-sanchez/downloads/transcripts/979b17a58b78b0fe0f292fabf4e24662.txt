POV: Your boyfriend desperately needed better work shirts, so you ran to CollarsandCo.com to get him some dress collar polos. I have single-handedly transformed his style with these. Just look at what he was wearing before, and the difference that these make. I just filled his closet with CollarsandCo and it was a total game changer. These are a staple in his wardrobe. He wears them every single day. He still feels comfortable in them since they're lightweight and made with stretchy fabric. He keeps getting compliments on them from his coworkers, and we can even dress them different ways for nights out and special events. Stop letting your man wear a flimsy collar and shop at CollarsandCo.
