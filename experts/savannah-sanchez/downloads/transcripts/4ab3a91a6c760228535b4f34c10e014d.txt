I found out how to get rid of the shadow ban on Instagram. My posts were hidden because I bought followers and used lots of hashtags. I found a better way to grow my page without spam. This is the social way. Their AI helps me reach my target audience, and my posts get lots of likes and comments. It’s nice to see real followers enjoying my posts instead of bots flooding my page with fake numbers and hurting my engagement. Growth was almost automatic—crazy, because it’s authentic. Delighted with Path Social, I wish I’d found it sooner. An easier way to grow on Instagram. Sign up now.
