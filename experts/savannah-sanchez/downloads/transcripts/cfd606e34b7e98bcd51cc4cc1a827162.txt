Okay, I went on a date last night and here's a story time. If you have social anxiety like me, you know how difficult it is to be in noisy places. Well, I'm at dinner trying to hear my date talk. I swear this had to be the loudest place we could have gone to. Everything was distracting from the cars outside, everyone around us eating. I mean, my anxiety was through the roof. Luckily, I had these loop engage plus earplugs. So I went to the bathroom, put them on and they reduce noise up to 16 decibels. And these mutes I have add another five and oh my gosh, it is such a lifesaver. The rest of the night, all my distractions were minimized, but I could still hear my date and myself talk clearly and they stayed in place. They were super comfortable and they honestly looked really cute with my outfit. I will definitely be wearing these every time I want a date or socializing.
