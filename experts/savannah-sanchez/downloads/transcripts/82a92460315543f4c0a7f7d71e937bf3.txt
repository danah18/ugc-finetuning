Stuff you should know about travel edition. These are Loop Quiet earplugs. I always feel overwhelmed and stressed out on a trip. Since using Loop Quiet earplugs while at the airport and on the plane, I finally have control of my noise sensitivity. With up to 26 decibels to block out distractions so I can focus. They're made with soft touch silicone and interchangeable eartip sizes so they're so comfortable to sleep with. Plus they're so cute. They look just like jewelry. Traveling just got a whole lot easier. Definitely add Loop to your packing list.
