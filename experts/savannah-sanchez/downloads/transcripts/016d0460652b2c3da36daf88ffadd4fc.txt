This vs. that, earplug edition. Most generic earplugs are ineffective because they don't fit properly in your ear canal, but with Loop, they're extremely effective because there's four interchangeable eartip sizes, making sure they always have a perfect fit.

Plus, they even come with a tiny little case, making them easy to carry around in your purse. Finally, most earplugs you have to throw away after a single use, but Loop earplugs are reusable and super easy to clean. Take the quiz now to find your perfect pair at loopearplugs.com.
