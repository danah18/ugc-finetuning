We all know that pumpkin season is upon us, and Truvani is feeding into my obsession with this healthier version of a pumpkin spice latte. This is their new pumpkin spice protein powder, and I am so here for it. You're going to fall in love with this cozy pumpkin taste, but fall even more in love with these ingredients. With just nine organic ingredients, this is by far the best plant-based protein powder I've ever found. Catch me drinking this all season long to keep me fueled while indulging in a tasty holiday treat. I'm telling you, you need to try this for yourself to understand the hype.
