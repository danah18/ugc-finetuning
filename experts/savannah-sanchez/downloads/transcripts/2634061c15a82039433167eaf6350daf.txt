Random things we pack to go camping that just makes sense. My husband and I love to travel, but we always make sure we try to stay on some sort of routine. And that means moving our bodies and making sure we're still eating somewhat healthy. So that's why one of the first things on my checklist to pack was our BlendJet. We love this thing so much because it's compact and literally fits anywhere. We can charge it right in our car and it's cordless so we can use it even in the most remote places. Plus it's super easy to clean on the go so we can continue to use it all day long. I highly recommend you get one of these for your next camping adventure.
