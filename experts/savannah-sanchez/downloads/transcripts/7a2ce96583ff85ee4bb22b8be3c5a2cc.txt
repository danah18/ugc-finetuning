Trust me, there's a better, tastier way. This was me before Dose, blending all the ingredients I thought I needed to keep my liver healthy. And I can't even describe how difficult this was to drink. Then I discovered this little wellness shot that not only has a higher potency of all those amazing ingredients, but it tastes like orange juice. I wish I discovered it sooner. It's made such a difference in my mood, focus, energy, and digestion. And that's all the result of actual liver support, with ginger, turmeric, and milk thistle. But in a delicious drink, I love taking every morning. Trust me, I'm shocked to admit that I actually look forward to my wellness shot. Who knew something so good for me could also taste so good, and saves me so much time and money? I love Dose Pure Liver. Take this as your sign to switch.
