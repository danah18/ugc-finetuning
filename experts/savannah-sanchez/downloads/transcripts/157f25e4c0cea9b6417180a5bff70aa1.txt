Three reasons why I regret shopping Diamond Art Club. Number one, it is too satisfying. Creating this was seriously so calming, I felt hypnotized. I'm now addicted to the process, you just press, pick, and place. Number two, the result has me obsessed. I couldn't help myself from hanging it right in the middle of my living room. I stare at it all the time and brag that I made it myself to all my guests. Number three, there's so many cool paintings to choose from. So now I have to run to diamondartclub.com and get more. It's all original artwork from highly experienced designers. This was such a fun activity that doubled as the cutest decor. If you're ready to be addicted like I am, check it out.
