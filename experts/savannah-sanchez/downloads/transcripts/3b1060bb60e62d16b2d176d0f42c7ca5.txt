The other day I was at Walmart and everyone and their mother had this BlendJet in their cart so I had to find it and buy one for myself to figure out what the heck the hype was about. Within a few hours of using it, I knew exactly why everyone was buying them. This thing is my new best friend and I literally take it everywhere. It's portable but easy to recharge, half the size of my old blender but just as powerful, plus it's self-cleaning so I just add soap and water and blend it for a few cycles. Then rinse it out and it's good as new. You can also get it at Walmart or on their website at BlendJet.com.
