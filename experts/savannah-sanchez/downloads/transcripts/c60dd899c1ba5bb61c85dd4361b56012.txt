Not sure which Truvani protein flavor to try first? Well, you can't really go wrong with any of them, but I got you. Did you know that they have a variety pack of their best-selling flavors and single servings? Well, now you do. And some of my go-to recipes are, I love making protein pancakes with this banana cinnamon flavor. It's so bomb. And then you can make iced coffee, iced lattes with the chocolate, and you can't go wrong with a fruit smoothie with your classic vanilla. These little packets are great on the go. You just slip one into your purse or your gym bag or travel bag and get 50% off the sample packs plus free shipping when you order one today.
