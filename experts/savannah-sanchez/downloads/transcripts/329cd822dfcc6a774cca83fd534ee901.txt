Okay, look, I don't know if you relate to this, but I get like so stressed out when I'm hanging out. Oh, yeah. Like I feel so overwhelmed. I can't focus. You get like shaky, slutty. Okay, so like my noise sensitivity used to be at an all-time high when I hang out with people. That's why I started wearing these. Wait, what are they? These, they're earplugs. So they're the loop-engaged design, so it actually like reduces noise, but it's still comfortable to keep a conversation. Oh, I love those. Yeah. The moment you realize you have noise sensitivity in social settings. I noticed I was always anxiously shaking and I had a really hard time keeping conversation. But then I found loop earplugs and it has been such a game changer. I took their quiz online and was matched with their engaged design. It has up to 16 decibels of noise reduction, which is perfect for me, so I can feel comfortable socializing while still staying active in conversation. And I honestly forget I'm even wearing them since they're so comfy. They fit perfectly since they come with interchangeable ear tip sizes. I even get compliments on them because they're so cute. I take these everywhere with me. Shop them now at loop earplugs.com.
