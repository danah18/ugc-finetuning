Your 2024 glow-up starts with better beauty products. Every time I talk about the free samples I try from home, I get asked how do I get them, and that's with Airshop. They have so many brands to choose from, from luxury, celebrity to viral products, and the samples look like this. They get shipped straight to my door, and this little QR code helps you to get the full size. So in my Airshop bag of little samples, I got this. It was the Alley Oop Eyeshadow Eyeliner Stick in Charcoalite, and I just loved it. I thought it really complimented my skin tone, so I went ahead and I got the full size, and I'm so excited. I have restocked on all my favorite products, so I am ready for the new year, and I am starting fresh. I'm testing new skincare essentials and makeup, and I'm leveling up in 2024 with Airshop.
