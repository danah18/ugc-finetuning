Three things about owning a Velotric Nomad 1 e-bike that will convince you to get one. Number one, daily commutes are way easier. This rides up to 25 miles per hour, so I get from place to place so quickly. With Shimano 8-speed and a 750-watt rear hub motor. Number two, it saves time and money. I don't have to sit in traffic every day, and it actually has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 55 miles, so I'm not spending my entire wallet on gas. Number three, it gets me active and outdoors. It's screen-free, gives me a breath of fresh air, and is honestly such a fun experience. Learn more about the Velotric Nomad 1 at velotricbike.com.
