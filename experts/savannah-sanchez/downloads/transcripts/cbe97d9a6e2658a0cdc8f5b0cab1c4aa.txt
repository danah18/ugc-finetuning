This is a PSA to all my guys out there. Your collars need an upgrade. I get all of my staple pieces from Collars and Co. This is the quarter zip sweater. Just look at how this stays popped. It comes in a bunch of colors. The fit is on point, and the fabric is so soft, it's really comfortable to wear all day. I've gotten compliments from my coworkers and my friends. My wife loves them. Collars and Co has seriously leveled up my closet.
