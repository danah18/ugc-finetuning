We need to talk about the real MVP here, these Kinfield relief patches. I am a huge fan of their bug spray, which is like 99% effective, but occasionally I forget to spray a spot. Somehow that mosquito always figures out exactly where it is, and when that's the case, I pull out these. They're these little adhesive patches that come in different sizes, so you just apply them right to the spot. Really discreet, so it doesn't look like you really have anything on, prevents you from itching them, and it has ingredients like witch hazel and arnica extract that actually help soothe the spot.
