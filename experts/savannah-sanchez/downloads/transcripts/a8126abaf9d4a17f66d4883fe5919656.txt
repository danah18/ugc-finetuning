BlendJet, you have some explaining to do because this blender is just too good. I got this BlendJet 2 for all my smoothies and recipes, and it has made staying on my wellness grind so much easier. I can blend on the go since it's portable, it's way cuter than my old and heavy machinery, and it's way easier to wash since it cleans itself. I just don't understand why I didn't shop this sooner.
