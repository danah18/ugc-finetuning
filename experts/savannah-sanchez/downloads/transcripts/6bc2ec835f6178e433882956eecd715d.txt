Stuff I bought online part 13. The BlendJet fandom is no joke. These portable blenders are everywhere, and honestly the hype makes sense. Making recipes in this thing is so much faster, it doesn't take up as much space on your counter, and it's also rechargeable to take on the go. The only thing difficult about it is when you shop at BlendJet.com, it's seriously so hard to decide which design to get. Every single one is so cute, but I guess that means there's styles for everyone. Also, BlendJet has a new drinking lid that makes sipping on the go so much easier. Everyone's obsessed, and I totally get it. Run to check out BlendJet.
