This e-bike is how I get around my busy city while enjoying the fall weather. I ride over to some of my go-to spots like the Fort Lauderdale Riverwalk, Pura Vida, and the beach without getting stuck in traffic. I can go up to 65 miles on a full charge with pedal assist, so that makes it easier to go all over town and the seat is ultra comfortable, ideal for long distances. I got my Velotric Discover One over six months ago and spent much of my summer on it, but this is my favorite time of year to get outside. They're having a Black Friday preview sale right now, so it really is the perfect time to get one. Whether you want to ride for yourself or if you know someone who'd love an e-bike, it would be an epic gift to give. Check it out at velotricbike.com.
