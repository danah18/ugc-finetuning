The girlfriend effect is so real because look at my husband. Before me, this is what he was wearing. I can't believe he was leaving the house in a floppy collar like this. Thankfully, I'm in his life now and I style him like this. This is way more elevated. I shop for him at Collars & Co. and I like that he looks professional, he looks sophisticated, and he likes that they're still stretchy and comfortable. And the collar is really firm so he doesn't have to worry about it all day. It stays up. I definitely think this has elevated his confidence. I love how versatile they are. We can dress them in different ways for different occasions. I'm so glad these are a staple in his closet now.
