Why I regret adding these Loop Quiet earplugs to my daily routine. Reason number one, it's just too effective. I can't believe I've gone so long without these. They reduce noise up to 26 decibels. Distractions are minimized, and I feel way less overwhelmed. Reason number two, my sleep is just too good. These have completely transformed rest for me. The soft-touch silicone design really is just cherry on top. They are insanely comfortable. Reason number three, my productivity is absolutely insane. I almost get too much done with these. These stay in my ears all day, every day, and they never budge. Thanks to the interchangeable ear tip sizes, I'm telling you, if you're looking for earplugs, you're going to be obsessed with Loop.
