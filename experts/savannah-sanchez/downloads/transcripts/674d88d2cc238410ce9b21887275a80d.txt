I couldn't stop myself from getting distracted all day until I tried these. Loop Quiet earplugs are a must-have for me while working remotely. I love going to a coffee shop to be productive, so these reusable earplugs help me stay focused no matter what's going on around me. They offer up to 26 decibels of noise reduction, so my work is truly the only thing that matters when I'm wearing them. Plus, they don't only look super cute, they're also super comfortable because of the soft-touch silicone they're made from. Boost your productivity and crush the day with Loop.
