Part three of concert essentials. Okay, I go to a lot of concert, guys, and I have to be proactive about keeping my ears safe. That's why I will never go to another concert, festival, a stadium game, or anything like that without my earplugs. These are the loop experience plus ones and just look at how stunning they are. Honestly, they elevate my fit while providing me with up to 18 decibels of noise reduction and an added five decibels if I really need it. I just pop in this little mute accessory and then I'm good to go. Oh, and I know what you're all thinking. Don't you want to hear the music though? Yes, of course I do. That's why these are just perfection because you can still hear clearly, it's just at a safer volume. I highly suggest grabbing a pair of loop earplugs before your next concert.
