They have three different styles which are all fire: quiet, experience, and engage. So whether you're trying to catch a nap, enjoy a concert, or focus in a noisy office, Loop has you covered with the perfect design for your lifestyle. They even have this experience plus and engage plus which offer this fancy mute accessory that adds an extra five decibels.
