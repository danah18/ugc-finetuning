I saw this e-bike on TV, so I bought it. Everyone has been hyping up this Velotric Nomad 1. After the first ride, I understood. This is my new favorite thing. It comes in eco-friendly packaging, so easy to assemble, then charge it up, adjust the seat, and enjoy the smooth adventure. Because no matter where you are, this bike has got you. From the hydraulic disc brakes, durable tires, Shimano 8-speed, and 750-watt rear hub motor, this sleek design has us all obsessed. Velotric is so confident you'll love it, there's a 14-day trial. I wish I would have gotten it sooner. Take it from my TV and shop velotricbike.com.
