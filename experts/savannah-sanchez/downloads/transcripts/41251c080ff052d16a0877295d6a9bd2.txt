If there's one thing I'm going to bring for a trip, it's these, my reusable earplugs from Loop. I'm heading off to Mexico for my bachelor trip. I'm going to need all the sleep I can get. These Loop Quiet Earplugs are so clutch. With 26 decibels of noise reduction, I can rest up on the entire flight. Then in the loud Airbnb when I need to catch a power nap, they totally come in handy. I just love how comfortable they are with the soft touch silicone, and they really help block out all my friends when I need it to. I won't leave for any trip without these compact, effective, and sleep earplugs. Go get yourself some at loopearplugs.com.
