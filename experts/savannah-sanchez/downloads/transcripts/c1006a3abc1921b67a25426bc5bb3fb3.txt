In case you haven't heard, Velotric is doing can't-miss deals right now so you can save hundreds on the e-bike that you've been wanting all year long. So you can either get one and save for yourself, or drop a subtle hint to someone that's been asking you what you want this year. And trust me, when you have an e-bike, it is so much easier to keep up with your New Year's resolutions to stay more active. The Go One is a perfect hybrid for someone that's just wanting to get into an e-bike and that wants to use it for more practical things like running errands around town. But it's still really fun to ride on trails or even commuting. Get a bike and all the accessories to come with it at velotricbike.com.
