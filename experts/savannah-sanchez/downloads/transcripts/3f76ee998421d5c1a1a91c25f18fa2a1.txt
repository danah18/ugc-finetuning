Nope, you are not dreaming. Truvani just dropped their new pumpkin spice flavor in their legendary protein powder, and yes, it's just as good as you could imagine. I've always loved Truvani organic protein powder because their ingredients are just perfection. No dairy, no gluten, no soy, and all plant-based protein. But this new pumpkin spice flavor just takes it to the next level. I'm getting all the cozy fall vibes from this. I'm telling you, you have to run to Truvani.com to grab this flavor before it sells out.
