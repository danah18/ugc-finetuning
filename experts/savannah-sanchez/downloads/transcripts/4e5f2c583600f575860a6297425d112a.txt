New favorite addition to my everyday jewelry, these loop earplugs. Just as sleek and stylish as earrings, but their quiet design helps me reduce interrupting sounds so I can sleep and focus. Their engaged design lets me zone in on my conversation and not let my social anxiety get in the way. Their experience plus is always ready for a good time, keeping my ears protected during loud nights of music, dancing, or sports. Check out loopearplugs.com.
