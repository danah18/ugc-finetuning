Most people do this wrong when it comes to earplugs. They use squishy ones like these that are gross after just one wear and are constantly falling out of their ears. But if I'm being honest, I was that person until Loop. Their quiet design changed my opinion on earplugs. They're made with soft-touch silicone, so not only do they feel sturdy in my ear, but they're also reusable. They come with these ear tip sizes, so they fit just right and never budge. I wear these while I sleep and work. They reduce noise up to 26 decibels, so I can minimize distractions. I am now obsessed with earplugs. I seriously can't go a day without them. So go take their quiz at loopearplugs.com and get your own pair.
