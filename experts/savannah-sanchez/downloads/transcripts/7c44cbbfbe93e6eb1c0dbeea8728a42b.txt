If you're a fan of these scents right here and don't know what the essence vault is, keep watching. So basically, they create these beautiful fragrances, which are all inspired by popular scents, but here's the kicker, for a fraction of the price, right? So you can smell like your favorite designer perfume without breaking the bank. I have been searching for quality designer dupes for so long, and honestly, these are hard to beat. On top of how amazing they smell, they're also long-lasting, look so luxurious in your bathroom, and they're vegan cruelty-free. I definitely recommend grabbing a bottle or two for yourself now.
