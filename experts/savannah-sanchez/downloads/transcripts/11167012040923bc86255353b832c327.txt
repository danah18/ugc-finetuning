Okay, this is for my ladies whose men love to pull out the golf polo when it's time to go to dinner. It doesn't look like it's a nice elevated polo, right? This belongs on the golf course. You need to get your man one of these. This is a dress collar polo. It's from Collars & Co. A dress shirt collar on a comfortable polo. He cannot complain about comfort. These are literally the most comfortable polos my husband owns, all thanks to me by the way. Versatile too, so they can wear them to work. This is the one I got for him. It's a semi-spread collar polo. They come in regular, tall, small through 4XL, and a ton of colors. And rightfully so, they were on Shark Tank because the idea is honestly genius. I wish I thought of it.
