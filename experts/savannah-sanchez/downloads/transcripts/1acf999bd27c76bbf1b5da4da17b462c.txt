Top protein tips coming from an avid hiker. I used to tap out on intense hikes early on because I didn't properly prepare. That's when I quickly realized a protein cheek is definitely necessary before any outdoor adventure. Personally, I've been loving this new pumpkin spice protein powder from Truvani, especially during this little fall getaway that we're on. Their plant-based protein powder is so smooth, dairy-free, and most importantly, keeps me fueled all day with 20 grams of protein. So now I can tackle the most challenging of hikes with confidence and energy. Order yours at Truvani.com.
