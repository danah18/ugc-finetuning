Random things your future self will thank you for. Wearing earplugs at concerts doesn't mean you have to use those awful neon orange foam ones, when Loop has these. Earplugs designed specifically for experiences like this, allowing you to enjoy the music, dance as much as you'd like, and protect your eardrums all night, so years from now you can still enjoy those same concerts. Visit loopearplugs.com to shop all the colors.
