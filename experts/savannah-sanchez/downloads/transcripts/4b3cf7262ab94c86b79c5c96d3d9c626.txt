What I think about when I'm traveling wearing Loop Quiet earplugs. This is about to be the quietest flight ever. Whoa, we already landed? That was a fire nap. I wonder if anyone knows I can't hear them. Geez, I am jet lagged. I'm just gonna fall asleep real quick. I gotta get some more of these from Loop. So many flights, so many shuttles, so many boats. Loop earplugs.
