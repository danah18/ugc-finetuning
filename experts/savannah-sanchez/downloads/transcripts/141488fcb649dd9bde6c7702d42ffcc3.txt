I just found the most useful thing when going through terrible twos. Loop Engage earplugs, the ultimate hack to staying productive without missing a beat. These are reusable earplugs designed to help take the edge off with 16 decibels of noise reduction. They are perfect for parenting since they simply limit the volume but not block out all the noise, so I can focus without interrupting her playtime. Plus, they're so comfortable and fit perfectly with interchangeable ear tip sizes, so I can literally wear them day in and day out. Try some out for yourself at loopearplugs.com.
