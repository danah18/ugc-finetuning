Meet my new travel BFF, Loop Quiet earplugs. I will not go on a trip without these. They make focusing and sleeping on the plane so much easier. With up to 26 decibels of noise reduction and interchangeable ear tip sizes for the perfect fit, these are so much better than the squishy earplugs they give you on the plane. It honestly makes traveling feel way less stressful. I don't feel so overwhelmed as I usually do. Once you travel with Loop, you'll never go back.
