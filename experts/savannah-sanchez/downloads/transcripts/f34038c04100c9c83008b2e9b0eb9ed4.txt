Things that will convince you to get a BlendJet. For starters, this is a compact and portable blender so I can take it with me literally anywhere. Number two, I love that they're just as powerful as any bulky blender but take up a quarter of the space. They can even fit in my cup holder so I can go and run errands throughout the day and have my BlendJet with me. Number three, they are self-cleaning. Yeah, do I even need to say anything else? I hate cleaning my blenders so the fact that I can throw some soap and water in this one, blend it up, and then it's clean is amazing. Finally, I'm obsessed with this new orbiter drinking lid. It makes it so easy to sip on the go. If you need even more convincing, go check out all the adorable colors and designs for yourself at BlendJet.com.
