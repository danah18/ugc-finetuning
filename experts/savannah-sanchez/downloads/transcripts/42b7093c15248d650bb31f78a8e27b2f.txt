I finally figured out how to get rid of the shadow ban on Instagram. My posts were being hidden because I bought followers and used a lot of hashtags. I found a better way to grow my page without spam: Path Social. By using AI for my niche audience, my posts get a lot of likes. It's nice to see real followers who appreciate what I post, instead of bots that inflate numbers and lower engagement. The growth has been automaticâ€”crazy because it's authentic. I'm amazed by PathSocial and wish I'd found it sooner. There's an easier way to grow on Instagram: sign up today.
