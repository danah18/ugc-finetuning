This hack is going to save you hours if not days of research when it comes to finding new gear for ski season. Using women's snowboarding as an example, if you type in best women's snowboard on the internet, you're going to get over 17 million results. There is no possible way you could research all of them and know which one specifically is the best for you. And that's why Curated exists. When you chat with an expert like Nate here, who I got matched with, they're able to give you personalized recommendations based on your needs and make the process way less overwhelming. They really help you refine that search and go above and beyond explaining why that specific product is best for you. You can easily compare items side by side, refine your selections, and purchase all from one website. And that is curated.com.
