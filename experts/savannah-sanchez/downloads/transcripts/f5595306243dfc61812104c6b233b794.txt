What's in my ear? Just my number one travel necessity, Loop Quiet earplugs. When packing for my trip to Greece, I could not forget these bad boys. They're a lifesaver when on the flight to drown out distractions so I can nap or get some work done. Then, when I get there, we all know I'm going to be extremely jet lagged, so these allow me to sleep midday. They're this effective by offering up to 26 decibels of noise reduction. And I sleep comfortably because of the soft touch silicone design. I can't go on a trip without these powerful earplugs. Take the quiz to find your perfect pair at loopearplugs.com.
