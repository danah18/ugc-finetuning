This lid for my blender just changed the game. Meet my BlendJet 2 and its new spill-proof accessory, the Orbiter drinking lid. I just made my morning smoothie in it and we're going to put it to the test. But first, let's take a sip. Yup, delicious. Okay, now I just twist the top to close it. I'm putting it over my most prized possession, my computer of course, and no leaks. I took it for a drive and my car is still fresh and clean. I even put it in my bag and there's no smoothie on anything. I can sip in peace. 10 out of 10 for me. Run to get an adorable BlendJet and its cute sidekick at BlendJet.com.
