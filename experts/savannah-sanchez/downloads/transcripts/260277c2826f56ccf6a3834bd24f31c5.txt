If you have no idea where or how to start shopping for gear for this ski season, don't worry, I got you. When I was a beginning snowboarder just starting out, I had no experience. It was super overwhelming to shop for gear because there's so much to consider. There's boots, there's bindings, there's socks, there's gloves, there's goggles, there's helmets, there's boards, there's pants, there's jackets. Seriously, it's so much to consider. But a fellow snowboarder put me on to Curated and it seriously was a game changer for me. So step one, go and take the online quiz to help you narrow in on what you actually need. Step two, chat with an expert. There is 840 snowboarding experts on Curated. They're there to help you out. Step three, you pick the products that you need together. And there's even so many detailed reviews from customers, videos, and pros. Step four, you buy on Curated. And this entire process is 100% complementary. The only thing you pay for is the products that you want. Plus you get free shipping on orders over $50. Seriously, it's such a steal. Run to Curated.com.
