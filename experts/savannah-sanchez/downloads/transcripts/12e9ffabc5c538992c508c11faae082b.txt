You might think these earplugs are just to be stylish, but they're actually a game-changer for your ears. Loop Experience Plus earplugs has such sleek designs. But we don't just wear them because they look great with our jewelry and look for a night out, but because they reduce noise up to 18 decibels to make sure you're protecting your ears. These even have mutes with an extra 5 decibels, so they're great for loud concerts and festivals. Perfect fit with interchangeable ear tip sizes to jam out without them falling out. Compact to fit in your purse or pocket to take anywhere. These are the holy grail of earplugs. Shop them at loopearplugs.com.
