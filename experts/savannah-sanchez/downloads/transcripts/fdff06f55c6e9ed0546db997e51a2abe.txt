I finally figured out how to get rid of shadowbanning on Instagram. My posts were being hidden because I was buying followers and using a lot of hashtags. I found a better way to grow my page without spam—Path Social. By using AI for my niche audience, my posts get a lot of likes. It’s nice to see real followers who genuinely appreciate what I post, instead of bots that skew the numbers and lower engagement. The growth has been automatic—crazy because it’s authentic. Amazed by PathSocial, I wish I had found it sooner. There’s an easier way to grow on Instagram—sign up today.
