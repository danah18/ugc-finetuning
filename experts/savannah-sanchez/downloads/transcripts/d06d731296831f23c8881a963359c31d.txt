Salon Manicure vs. London Town. After years of gel and UV exposure, my nail beds were completely destroyed. They became weak and brittle, and don't even get me started on how expensive it got. But then I found this, Illuminating Nail Concealer from London Town. It makes it so easy to get a sustainable, salon-quality manicure at home. Combines color with care for a flawless blurring effect that also moisturizes my nails. The Pro Contour Brush and 2-coat application makes it so effortless.
