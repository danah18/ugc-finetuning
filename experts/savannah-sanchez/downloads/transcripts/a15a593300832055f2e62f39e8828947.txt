I can't believe I got away with this at a concert. Listening to loud music for hours and my ears didn't ring after. That's because I snuck these in my purse and wore them the whole time. These are Loop Experience Plus earplugs, the number one tip if you love concerts and festivals. Reduces noise up to 18 decibels and mutes for an extra 5 decibels, keeping my ears protected but you can still hear the music to jam out like everyone else, but without the hearing damage afterwards. And the best part is they actually add to your stylish look. Dance all night and they never budge with interchangeable ear tip sizes for the perfect fit. Wear these to your next concert and shop them at loopearplugs.com.
