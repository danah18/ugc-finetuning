Do you have a ton of cups and still don't drink enough water? You need to get these. I have too many cups I don't know what to do with, but no matter how cute the cup is, I still couldn't stand drinking the plain old water that was inside. So I've been adding these stir water enhancers to my water every day, and almost like magic, I never feel dehydrated anymore. There is zero calories, and there's no artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners, and there are tons of flavors to choose from, but today I'm going to go with the strawberry lemonade. It's seriously so good. Honestly, I crave them all and like to pick a different flavor for every day of the week. Try some out for yourself at stirredrinks.com.
