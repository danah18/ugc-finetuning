Much like everyone else, I am so extremely influenced to buy makeup products just because I see one beauty influencer hype it up. But I was so sick of wasting so much money for products to just collect dust at the back of my makeup drawer. That's why I finally decided to give Airshop's free samples a go. I'd been eyeing this Armani Beauty foundation for months but was so nervous I'd get the wrong shade or it wouldn't work with my skin. So I went ahead and got this foundation's box to try out a few shades as well as some of their other brands in case I liked one of those better. It was a breeze to test them out at home. It was free of pressure from employees, weird lighting, and it's safe to say Airshop literally saved me so much time and so much money. I found my perfect product and my perfect shade all thanks to them. Plus, since I joined their rewards program, I unlocked a discount on my full-size product. Try it for yourself at GoAirshop.com.
