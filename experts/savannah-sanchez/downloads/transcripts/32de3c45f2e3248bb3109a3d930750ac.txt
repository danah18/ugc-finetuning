I don't think I can ever go back to the beauty store again now that I know this secret hack. Everyone's hair is so unique and I ended up just wasting money on the wrong products because I didn't try them out first. Then I found out that Air Shop exists. With this, I'm able to get free samples delivered right to my door so I can actually test them out on my hair before committing to the full size. I had been eyeing this Blankenship shampoo and conditioner for a minute now so I went ahead and gave them a try as well as a few other brands to really know I was spending my money on the best option for me. I went with the Captain Blankenship shampoo and they delivered the full size the same day. I swear, testing products couldn't be any easier. Ditch the crowded beauty stores and check out Air Shop instead.
