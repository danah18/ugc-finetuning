Okay, I am so glad my friend put me on to Loop Engage Plus earplugs. We were literally just talking about how we both deal with social anxiety, and it all stems from our noise sensitivity. But these reduce noise up to 16 decibels, and if that isn't enough, they even have mutes to add for an extra 5. I started wearing these, and I absolutely love them. Distracting background noise is way less overwhelming, but I can still clearly hear myself and the person I'm talking to. And it's definitely a plus that they're stylish and come with interchangeable ear tip sizes. Check them out at loopearplugs.com.
