Meet the latest e-bike from Velotric. This Thunder One ST is one of the most exciting new e-bikes on the market for several reasons. Weighing only 36 pounds, it doesn't look like your typical e-bike. It's sleek, ultralight, and easy to store at my apartment. The compatibility with Find My on Apple devices gives me peace of mind that I can always track it down. The 36-volt, 352.8-watt-hour battery is hidden inside the frame along with all the wiring. It's powered by Velotric's proprietary E35 drive system with torque sensor technology, providing a smooth and quiet ride assist, with up to 52 miles of range. Living in a busy city, this is the perfect way to avoid traffic, head to my favorite spots without worrying about parking, and go wherever I need, faster than walking. I expect this to sell out fast, so learn more and check it out at velotricbike.com.
