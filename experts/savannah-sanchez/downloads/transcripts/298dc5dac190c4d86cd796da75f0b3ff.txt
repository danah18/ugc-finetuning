Products I purchased this year that would be great gifts, part five. I think this portable blender right here would be such a cute and practical gift for literally anyone. I got a BlendJet this past year and I kid you not, I use it on the daily. I am so pumped to go through my gifting list and pick a color or design based off my friends' aesthetics. It's so powerful, compact, and even self-cleaning. You could even throw on this super cool Orbiter lid, so don't fumble on gifts this year and go check out BlendJet.com.
