What makes Velotric the best choice for e-bikes? Let's see. First of all, the Nomad 1 is hands down the sweetest ride. This bike has such a sleek look, I get compliments wherever I go. And I don't know what's better, the 750 watt rear hub motor, hydraulic disc brakes, Shimano 8-speed, or 48 volt battery. But this thing is the smoothest and most powerful ride ever. I ride this no matter the terrain or weather. And if you live in an area with lots of hills, I promise you this is a lifesaver. It's next level with a 50% longer range that can last up to 55 miles at as fast as 25 miles per hour. I'm so glad I chose the Velotric Nomad 1 when I was looking to get an e-bike. It just doesn't get better than this. Definitely check this one out.
