Things I'm wearing to the concert tonight that just make sense. So we're going to a super popular rap artist concert tonight. It's in a huge, huge stadium and we're going to be dancing, we're going to be screaming, we're going to be jumping. It's going to be insane. It's going to be a lot. In addition to exposing our ears to super high volume levels and that's why I can't leave without these. Without my Loop Experience Plus earplugs. They're my favorite concert hack. They use an acoustic channel and mesh to filter noise and don't worry, you can still hear the music so clearly, just at a lower volume. They even come with this neat accessory that adds an extra five decibels of noise reduction for when the band just gets extra loud. I like to just throw these in my little stadium bag because it takes up zero space. I just pop them in when we get there and they're actually really cute too. Head to loopearplugs.com and get some for yourself.
