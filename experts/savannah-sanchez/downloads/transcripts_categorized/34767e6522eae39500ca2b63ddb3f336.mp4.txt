Zenni, affordable eyewear with a virtual try-on feature, Looking for affordable eyewear? I got you. I just got three new pairs from Zenni. And no, I didn't drain my wallet. These are actually insanely affordable, which is why I was able to get so many cute pairs. I used the virtual try-on to make sure I liked the way they looked, but these beat my expectations. I can style so many outfits and switch up my everyday look. Zenni is such a steal.
