blender, portable USB-rechargeable blender for making smoothies and drinks on the go, I just got the blender and it is literally the best portable blender. I made a quick espresso smoothie and it blended like butter. This blender is lightweight and has a USB charging so it's easy to take anywhere too. I ordered their pearl metallic color and just completely in love and can't wait to keep trying new recipes with this. Check it out before it's gone.
