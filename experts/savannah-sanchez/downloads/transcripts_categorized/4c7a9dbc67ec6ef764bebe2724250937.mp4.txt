Loop, earplugs that reduce noise by 18 decibels while preserving sound clarity for safe listening at concerts and events, My favorite silver accessory explained. You can probably guess where I'm going. A very loud concert where I'll be dancing all night long. That's why I can't leave without my Loop Experience earplugs. They're designed with 18 decibels of noise reduction and an acoustic channel and mesh to filter noise instead of muffling it, so you can still hear clearly, just at a safer volume. Plus, there's interchangeable eartips so you can dance around as much as your heart desires without worrying about them moving. Loop is really out here making ear protection cool again.
