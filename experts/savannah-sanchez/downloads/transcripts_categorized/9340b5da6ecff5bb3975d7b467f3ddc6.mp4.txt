Collars & Co., men's quarter zip sweaters made from Australian merino wool that are lightweight, breathable, and stylish, If your man values comfort in his clothing but he still wants to look really put together, this is your sign to get him a quarter zip. But not just any quarter zip, one from Collars & Co. This is one of my husband's favorite brands and this one is made with Australian merino wool. Very lightweight and breathable, super soft to the touch, not itchy or irritating at all. And I love the little leather detailing on the zipper pull. They have several others that are more neutral or green or gray or tan. Collarsandco.com has all of them. So if you're looking for something to get your man this year, this is it.
