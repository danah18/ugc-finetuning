Fracture, prints photos directly onto glass for easy, high-quality, ready-to-mount wall art, What I ordered versus what I got from Fracture. Printing and framing pictures can be such a hassle, but I really wanted our family photos on this blank wall in our house, and when I heard about FractureMe.com, I decided to try it. The ordering process literally took me a couple of minutes, it was delivered right to my home, and these honestly beat my expectations. They are just incredibly stunning and high quality. I love that they come completely ready to mount, and they just brighten up the whole room. They add such a personalized touch to our house, and finally gave these photos the place they deserve. Fracture gets a 10 out of 10 from me.
