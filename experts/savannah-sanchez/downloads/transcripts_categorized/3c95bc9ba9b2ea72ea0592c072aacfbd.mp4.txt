Velotric Nomad 1, electric bike with large tires suitable for urban commuting and winter conditions, I got him the best gift last Christmas and now he uses it everywhere in Chicago. I got this thing. It's called the Velotric Nomad 1. It's amazing. It's so fast. Look at these tires. I mean they're just massive. Look at these things. Actually it's served me really well in the Chicago winter when I just don't want to have to hop in the car and drive through traffic. I can hop on this bad boy, get in the bike lane. I'm in my destination probably in five minutes and I'm good to go. The best gift ever.
