Loop, noise-reducing earplugs designed to help people manage overstimulation and background noise while allowing awareness of their surroundings, Overstimulated on your commute? Try this. Traveling anywhere in crowded places can get very overwhelmingly loud. Listening to music in my headphones honestly didn't help because it just added to the constant noise. So, I got these earplugs from Loop after seeing a ton of reviews about them. I went with the Engage Plus so that I can still hear what's going on around me if I need to, but it reduces the volume significantly, enough so that I can relax or be productive while commuting, work at a busy coffee shop office without distraction, even if you don't commute daily. These are life-changing for those easily overstimulated by background noises anywhere you are. Check out more colors from Loop on their website, loopearplugs.com.
