BlendJet, portable blender for making smoothies and juices on the go, Surprising my stepmom with a gift she'll actually use on the daily. Finding unique gifts for everyone in my family is hard, so I was really excited when I found BlendJet. My stepmom has been juicing and making smoothies recently, so the BlendJet was perfect for her. There are tons of cute color options, but I chose the black for her, and she already loves it. Goodbye, bulky, massive blender. Hello, sleek, portable BlendJet. She is an on-the-go girly, so something that is compact and portable for the gym or errands is a must. Every time I visit, she's making smoothies now, and it's so cute. Plus, the fact that it has 15 blends per one-hour charge is pretty amazing. Simplify your loved one's lives by gifting them a BlendJet at BlendJet.com.
