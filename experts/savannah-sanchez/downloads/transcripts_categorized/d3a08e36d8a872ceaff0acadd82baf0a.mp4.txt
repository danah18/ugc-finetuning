Loop, noise-filtering earplugs that reduce distractions from surrounding sounds without being bulky or noticeable, If you are easily distracted and overstimulated by noise, you are not alone in this. I can hardly get task-related things done when my dishwasher is running, when my dogs are barking, when my neighbor is mowing his lawn. So what I do to combat it is wear these noise-filtering earplugs. They are the Engage earplugs from Loop. You honestly can't even tell that I'm wearing them when I'm facing forward. And they're not these bulky, huge, noise-canceling headphones that I know you've all seen. They come in a bunch of colors, and this little carry case comes with it too.
