Loop, noise-reducing earplugs designed to help with napping, working in public, and reducing noise sensitivity and anxiety, Here's how I use my Loop Quiet earplugs on the daily. Number one, taking a nap, especially when I have cute crazy doggies jumping all over me. Number two, working. While out in public, this really boosts my productivity. Number three, reduce noise sensitivity. Whether I'm trying to work or read, this really calms my anxiety to just put them in and focus on what I'm trying to do. You've got to give these a try.
