Diamond Art Club, diamond painting kits for creating sparkly wall art, I understand the hype after trying Diamond Art Club. I've been seeing this sparkly artwork everywhere, and I was hooked when I saw over 200,000 five-star reviews. So I got the schoolwork and friends painting. I honestly was shocked at how addicting this process was. I expected it to be a lot more difficult, but you just simply press, pick, and place the stones. It is so satisfying to create. I felt so calm and in the zone while making this. Before I knew it, it was complete. I couldn't help myself but hang it in my living room. I've been looking for wall decor, and this was perfect. I've gotten so many compliments on it, and I definitely take every chance I get to say I made it myself. I'll be shopping more original artwork from Diamond Art Club. You should definitely check it out for yourself.
