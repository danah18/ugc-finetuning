Loop Engage Plus, earplugs designed to reduce noise sensitivity while allowing natural conversation, offering comfort with interchangeable ear tips and customizable noise reduction., Top three questions I always get asked about my earplugs. Number one, why do you wear them? I wear these Loop Engage Plus earplugs because they're specifically designed for noise sensitivity. They help me focus, socialize, and overall feel less overwhelmed and anxious. Number two, can you still hear? Yes, I love these because they have a newly engineered filter so I still sound natural while having a conversation. They reduce noise up to 16 decibels and this design is especially cool because they come with these little mutes that you add for another five decibels. Number three, are they actually comfortable to wear? Honestly, I forget I'm wearing them most of the time since they fit perfectly. If earplugs always fall out of your ears, these come with interchangeable ear tip sizes. I use them all the time, everywhere I go, and they never bother me.
