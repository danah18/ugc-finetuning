Loop Experience Plus, high-fidelity earplugs designed to protect hearing at events and concerts while maintaining sound quality and comfort, What people are saying about the Loop Experience Plus earplugs: Love the look and the fit. Wore them to a festival and the music still sounds so good. These are not only comfortable but very stylish. I'm ordering more colors. Obsessed. At an event the music comes through clear while all the background noise has been limited to the minimum. Love the different ear tip sizes. The extra small is perfect for me. Bought them specifically for concerts and events where the music was too loud and I wanted to protect my hearing. The sound quality remains the same and comfort-wise they are great and easy to carry because of the small case. I used Loop Experience Plus at the last festival I attended. They fit so well and are really comfy. Most of the time I forgot I even had them on.
