Zinni, stylish eyeglasses in various shapes and colors, Style Zinni with me. Up first we have the square glasses and classic tortoise shell. I'm pairing these glasses with some cargo jeans and a sweater, just a quick outfit to run errands in. Second we have these round gold glasses. Definitely want to dress these up, so I'm pairing them with this beige dress, white blazer, and over-the-knee boots. And lastly we have these geometric shaped tortoise shell glasses. And I put this with this black turtleneck, faux leather beige skirt, and some boot heels. I love these so much. All of these are adorable. Shop Zinni.
