Collars & Co, dress collar polos that combine the look of a dress shirt with the comfort and lightweight feel of a polo, suitable for both casual and formal occasions., Hey ladies! If your man is still going out wearing flimsy collars and sweat stain prone shirts, you've got to put him onto Collars & Co. There's no denying I love to see him dressed up and now he can do that in comfort with these. I got him two of their dress collar polos, a plain white and this beautiful blue design, so the possibilities are endless. And he won't stop telling me how much he loves them because they're lightweight and look like a dress shirt while being incredibly comfortable. He can wear this to a business meeting, dinner date, honestly anywhere because they turn any outfit into a sleek and sophisticated look. I even caught him looking for more polos already to add to his wardrobe at collarsandco.com.
