Loop, earplugs that protect your hearing at loud events while still allowing you to enjoy the atmosphere., Here's the number one item I always sneak into stadium games. These earplugs from Loop. They protect your eardrums so that you don't have to endure that annoying ringing in your ears after the game anymore. The Experience Plus ones are designed specifically with an acoustic channel and mesh filter so that you can still be a part of the excitement, it hits just at a safer volume. You can even add this mute accessory for an added five decibels for when you really need it. They fit comfortably in your ears so no matter how much you jump around, they're not going anywhere. Cheer on your team in confidence all day with Loop.
