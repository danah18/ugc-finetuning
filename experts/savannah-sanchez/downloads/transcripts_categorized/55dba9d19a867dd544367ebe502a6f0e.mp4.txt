Loop, noise-reducing earplugs designed for focus and comfort, My number one hack for boosting productivity. If you're like me and tend to get distracted easily, I definitely think you should try using earplugs. But specifically, these quiet ones from Loop are my favorite. They offer up to 26 decibels of noise production, so my work is truly the only thing that matters when I'm wearing them. They're the real MVP. Plus, they don't only look super cute, they're also super comfortable because of the soft touch silicone they're made from. In addition to that, they even help me take a quick cat nap when I need a break from working all day. Grab a pair for yourself at loopearplugs.com.
