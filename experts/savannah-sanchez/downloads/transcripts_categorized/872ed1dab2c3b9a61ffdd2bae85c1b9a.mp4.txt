Airshop, a service that lets you sample beauty products at home before purchasing full sizes, I hate going to the beauty stores, so I found a way that eliminates that stuff. It's called Airshop. I'm going to sample and review the eight products that I got that I've been considering buying. First up, the Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil. I give it a 6 out of 10. The Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask. I give it a 9 out of 10. Moving on, the Charlotte Tilbury Highlighter Wand in Bot Light. 7 out of 10. 8 out of 10. 4 out of 10. Dior Addict Lip Glow. 10 out of 10. 7 out of 10. 8 out of 10. So, there were two products that got super high ratings that I love, so I decided to get the full size. And I got these from Airshop. I'm so glad I found Airshop because I was able to sample these at home, which is just so much more convenient than trying to find the time to go to the store.
