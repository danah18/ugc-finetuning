Loop, earplugs designed to reduce noise and provide quiet for travel and sleep, What I think about when I'm traveling wearing loop quiet earplugs. This is about to be the quietest flight ever. Whoa, we already landed? That was a fire nap. I wonder if anyone knows I can't hear them. Oh, geez, I am jet lagged. I'm just gonna fall asleep real quick. I gotta get some more of these from loop. So many flights, so many shuttles, so many boats. Ah, loop earplugs.
