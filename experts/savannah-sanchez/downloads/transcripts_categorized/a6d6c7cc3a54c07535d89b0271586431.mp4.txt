Loop, reusable earplugs designed to reduce background noise and help with noise sensitivity while maintaining comfort and clarity in conversation, I get asked this question a lot when I wear my Loop Engage Plus earplugs. I use them when I'm trying to socialize to feel less overwhelmed by loud background noises. You may deal with noise sensitivity and not even realize it like myself. It was so hard for me to stay focused and hold a conversation before these, but they reduce noise up to 16 decibels. They even have these mutes for an extra 5 decibels. They're made with a newly engineered filter too, so I still sound natural when I speak. I can hear whoever I'm talking to, but distractions are minimized. I've tried other earplugs in the past, but they can be ugly, bulky, they get gross after just one use, and they're constantly falling out of my ears. I love these since they're comfortable, reusable, easy to clean, and they have interchangeable ear tip sizes to fit and stay in place. You may not even know that you need earplugs for noise sensitivity, but these are a game changer. Take the quiz at loopearplugs.com and find out.
