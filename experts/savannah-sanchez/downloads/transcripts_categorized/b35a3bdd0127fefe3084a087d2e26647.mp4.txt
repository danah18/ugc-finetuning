Zenni, online retailer for affordable prescription glasses and eyewear, leftover FSA or HSA dollars, use them at Zenni. And they have amazing ways to shop. One, if you're on a budget, you can filter through all their glasses to what fits your style and your budget. Two, you can also do a virtual try-on that makes it way easier to figure out if you even like the way these look on you. I was looking at a luxury brand for a really long time and just didn't want to spend the money on them, so I did a visual search on Zenni's website and it worked so amazing and I got these really cute tortoise glasses and I absolutely love them. You have to go to zennioptical.com, use any of your FSA or HSA dollars before December 31st. Running don't walk, these are amazing and you won't regret it.
