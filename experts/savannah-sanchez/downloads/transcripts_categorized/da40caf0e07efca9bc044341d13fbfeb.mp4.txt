Loop Earplugs, earplugs designed for noise reduction including travel, music events, and everyday focus, Three ways I've used my Loop Earplugs this year. Quiet earplugs are my go-to for traveling. It's like hitting mute on the world and I would 10/10 recommend these for plane rides. I've worn my experience earplugs at every concert and festival to protect my eardrums so I can still clearly hear the music without ringing ears afterwards. The Engage earplugs get used almost daily, especially while I'm working. If even small sounds set you off and ruin your concentration, these are great for filtering background noises and keeping me on task throughout the day.
