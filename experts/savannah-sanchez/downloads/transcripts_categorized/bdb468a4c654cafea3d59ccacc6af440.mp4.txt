Loop, earplugs that filter noise rather than blocking it completely to help with focus and reduce sensitivity to sounds, The biggest misconception about my earplugs is that people think I can't hear anything when I wear them. But that is not the case. They filter out noise instead of blocking it out completely. I use them pretty much every day when I'm working, when I'm with a group and there's a ton of background noise, or on the days I'm just extra sensitive to sounds. These are the Engage earplugs from Loop. And if you want to really get in your focus bubble, check out their quiet design too on loopearplugs.com.
