Loop, earplugs designed to reduce noise for better sleep, If you have a partner that snores like mine, you have to try this tiny but mighty accessory called Loop. Loop Quiet Earplugs. They're designed with comfort in mind with soft touch silicone, so I can doze off to sleep and stay asleep for longer. Plus, they're ensured to stay put all night because of the four interchangeable eartip sizes. I kid you not, I used to constantly wake up in the middle of the night. If it wasn't because of my husband snoring, it was because of our rowdy dogs. But these offer up to 26 decibels of noise reduction. And because of these, restless sleep is a thing of the past.
