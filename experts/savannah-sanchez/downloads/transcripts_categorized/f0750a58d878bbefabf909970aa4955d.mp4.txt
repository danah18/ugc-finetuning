BlendJet, portable rechargeable blender for making smoothies and other blended recipes on the go, Random things I found at Walmart that in my opinion are worth every penny. You know it's good when everyone else has them in their carts too. These little BlendJets are so nice to have for making daily smoothies, salad dressings, and several other recipes. Plus being able to take it on the go is so convenient. It's pourable but easy to recharge, half the size of my old blender but just as powerful, plus it's self-cleaning so I just add soap and water and blend it for a few cycles. Then rinse it out and it's good as new. You can also get it at Walmart or on their website at blendjet.com.
