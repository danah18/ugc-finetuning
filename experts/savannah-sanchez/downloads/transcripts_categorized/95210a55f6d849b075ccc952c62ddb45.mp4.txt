Fracture, prints your photos directly onto glass to create ready-to-hang wall art, This is how easy it was to turn our family photos into a stunning wall art for our home. Framing your photos just got simpler. I just went to fractureme.com to make my photo wall, selected my pictures, chose my layout and sizing, and seriously, that's it. It took me a couple minutes, they're delivered to my door, ready to hang. These are hands down my favorite decor in our home. It's just stunning quality. I can't stop staring at it. All of my guests love them and ask me where I got them. I am telling everyone about Fracture.
