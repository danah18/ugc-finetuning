Truvani, plant-based protein powder (now available in pumpkin spice flavor), New fall flavor alert! So my favorite protein powder from Truvani just had the ultimate drop and I cannot contain my excitement. This is their new pumpkin spice flavor and when I tell you that I ran to order it, I'm not exaggerating. It's just transporting me to this cozy little pumpkin patch in the middle of fall and what's even better about this is that it's the same organic ingredients as all of their other flavors, just transformed into a seasonal treat. I didn't think their plant protein could get any better, but they've done it again. Grab your own bag now before they sell out.
