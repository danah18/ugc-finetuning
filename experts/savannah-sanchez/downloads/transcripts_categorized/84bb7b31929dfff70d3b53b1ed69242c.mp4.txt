Loop, earplugs that reduce noise by up to 26 decibels for comfortable sleep and focus during travel or noisy environments, Travel essentials you didn't know you needed. Now, I'm on my way to Greece for an epic Indian wedding that's three days long, so much music, dancing, but we get very little rest in between. So, I got these Loop Quiet earplugs because they offer up to 26 decibels of noise reduction to help drown out distractions. Whenever I got a chance to nap, I got these in. And I'm not lying when I say they were a lifesaver on the plane ride here. I mean, it was a long 11 hours. I was able to peacefully fall asleep and even got some work done. They're seriously so comfy too because of the soft-touch silicone and the interchangeable ear tips. Try them out for yourself at loopearplugs.com.
