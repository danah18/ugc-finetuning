Chobani, pumpkin spice protein powder that provides 20 grams of plant protein per serving and can be used to make low-sugar, pumpkin spice-flavored coffee drinks., I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Those pumpkin spice lattes that we all know and love have around 70 grams of sugar in them. I was shocked too. But Chobani just dropped this pumpkin spice flavor that I kid you not tastes the exact same but with 20 grams of plant protein in it and not all that added sugar. All right, so I'm gonna take one scoop of this pumpkin spice protein powder. Now I'm gonna take one shot of espresso and then any type of milk that you like. Then just froth it up, mix it all together. Then just fill it with ice and that's it. Give it a taste. It is so delicious. This is seriously my favorite fall treat and I love it that I'm getting my protein in while I'm having the most delicious morning coffee. Get your own at chobani.com.
