Collars & Co., shirts with super stiff collars that stay up and look crisp all day, offering the appearance of a dress shirt with greater comfort., So I recently did some shopping, but not for myself, but this guy right here, because he is still wearing shirts with these flimsy collars. I got three pieces for him from Collars & Co. So this is our model, and this is our first shirt. Okay, so here's this white one, and these are super cool Collars & Co. shirts that have a super stiff collar that literally doesn't fall down. So you look nice and clean and crisp all day. Next up is this colored one. Ooh, I might like this one more. Okay, so now I told him to go grab a blazer. Ooh, look at that! Stylin'! This looks just like a dress shirt, but it's way comfier, right babe? Oh yeah. Look at this guy, the stunner taking me on a date. Oh, and opening my door. You definitely need to be shopping for your man at collarsandco.com.
