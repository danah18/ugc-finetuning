Loop, silicone earplugs that minimize sounds by up to 26 decibels for better sleep and focus, Top tips from your fellow noise-sensitive girly. I have tried almost every solution on the planet to help me feel less overwhelmed, and I'm telling you, a good pair of earplugs like these Loop Quiets are a game changer. My restless nights and days trying to focus are over. They are more effective than anything else out there with minimizing sounds up to 26 decibels. It gives me that comfortable feel with the soft touch silicone, but has that solid circular structure to stay in place. It even comes in cute colors, they have interchangeable ear tip sizes to fit, and this cute little travel case to take on the go. I mean, it seriously doesn't get better than Loop. I'm getting deeper sleep, and I am more productive than ever before.
