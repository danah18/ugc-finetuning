Loop, reusable earplugs that reduce noise by 26 decibels to help you sleep or rest in loud environments, How to get sleep when you're on a group trip? Two words: loop earplugs. Look guys, I'm about to be on a bachelor trip with a group of dudes and we're going to be so loud and rowdy and I already know I'm not gonna have any sleep, so I made sure to pack my loop quiet earplugs. These are reusable earplugs and they are amazing. With 26 decibels of noise reduction, I can rest up on the entire flight. Then, in the loud Airbnb when I need to catch a power nap, they totally come in handy. I just love how comfortable they are with the soft touch silicone and they really help block out all my friends when I need it to. Go get yourself some at loopearplugs.com.
