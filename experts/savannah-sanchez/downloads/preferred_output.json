Traveling anywhere in crowded places can get very overwhelmingly loud. Listening to music in my headphones honestly didn't help because it just added to the constant noise. So I got these earplugs from Loop after seeing a ton of reviews about them. I went with the Engage Plus so that I can still hear what's going on around me if I need to, but it reduces the volume significantly. Enough so that I can relax or be productive while commuting, work at a busy coffee shop office without distraction. Even if you don't commute daily, these are life-changing for those easily overstimulated by background noises anywhere you are.

Luckily, I had these loop engage plus earplugs. So I went to the bathroom, put them on and they reduce noise up to 16 decibels. And these mutes I have add another five and oh my gosh, it is such a lifesaver.
