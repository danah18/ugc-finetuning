}, Here's what I spent this month on ClassPass. As someone on a budget, I'm on the 43 credit plan, which is only $89 a month, and it's such a good deal. First, I used 6 credits on Pilates. Next, I let off some steam in boxing with 8 credits, and it got very sweaty. Then I found my inner zen for 8 credits. I also tried pole dancing, and I wasn't that good, but it was a blast, and it was only 3 credits. Finally, I hit the gym with a friend, so here you start taking a selfie while I ran in the background. We also love hopping in the pool, and all these gym visits were only 12 credits. And guys, ClassPass is currently offering two weeks free, so there's no better time to try it.
