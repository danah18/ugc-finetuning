  "product_description": "A supportive, wireless bra featuring flexible side boning for structure and support without underwire. It is designed to be comfortable like a sports bra while offering lift and separation similar to a traditional bra. The bra prevents back bulge and side spillage, fits like a second skin, is flattering, maintains its shape after washing, and is suitable for both everyday wear and as part of an outfit."
}, I was seeing this bra all over my Instagram feed. I'm sure you're seeing it too. It was sold out in my size forever and I finally got it and oh my gosh, it is definitely worth the wait. This bra is super supportive without underwire and one of the ways that it does that is it has this really flexible, sleek side boning. So I absolutely love the feel of this bra and it's crazy that you can get that much support from a bra that has absolutely no underwire. It doesn't cut into you. There's no back fat. You don't need to worry about that. There's no side boob problem. It's like a second skin. It's very supportive and it's still really cute. Like it's really sexy and cute. For me, it's kind of a mix between a sports bra and a regular bra. You've got the comfortability of a sports bra, but you have the lift and separation that a real bra would give you. This bra is so flattering that I actually like to incorporate it into my outfits. I've washed it. It doesn't stretch. It doesn't sag. The quality is phenomenal. It's game over for other bras for me.
