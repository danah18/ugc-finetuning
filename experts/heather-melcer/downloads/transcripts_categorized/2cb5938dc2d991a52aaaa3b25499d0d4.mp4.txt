}, Not everyone has the whole day to make fresh dumplings from scratch, so when I'm in a pinch for time, Fly By Jing dumplings are my favorite to use. When you buy their dumpling starter pack, you can save $70 on their three different dumplings along with their signature sauces. I've always loved using their chili crisps and zong sauce, and they work perfectly with these super juicy and flavorful dumplings. I'm going to show you my favorite way to enjoy these, so first boil the pork, shrimp, and mushroom dumplings for 8 minutes, and in a separate bowl combine 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of Chinese black vinegar, grated garlic, and 2 tablespoons of the zong sauce. Toss the boiled dumplings in the sauce and garnish with scallions, and that's it. Enjoy!
