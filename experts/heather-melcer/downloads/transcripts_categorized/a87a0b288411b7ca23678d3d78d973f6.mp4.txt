}, Hi there, we're the sibling behind siblings. I'm Eva. I'm David. Yes, we're actually siblings. We started Siblings with a mission to help tackle throwaway culture. Our first product is candles. The average candle creates a lot of waste, from glass jars that don't get reused or recycled, to paraffin wax that's made from petroleum byproducts, and artificial scents that lead to headaches. We saw an opportunity to create candles that are clean on multiple fronts. We use a natural coconut blend wax with non-toxic fragrance and essential oils, and our bags are plant-based and 100% compostable, so we encourage reusing existing vessels to make new candles. It couldn't be easier. Melt, pour, and enjoy.
