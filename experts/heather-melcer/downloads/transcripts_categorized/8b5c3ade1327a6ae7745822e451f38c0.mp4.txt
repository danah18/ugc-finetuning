}, Gut health tip of the day. Take a probiotic, but not just any probiotic. This is Ritual's Symbiotic Plus. It's actually a three-in-one gut support supplement featuring clinically studied prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics to support microbiome balance. A lot of the time, we only think of probiotics when it comes to gut health, but there are other ingredients like prebiotics and postbiotics that may be lesser known but are equally as important. The prebiotics in Symbiotic Plus support the growth of probiotics. Postbiotic provides fuel to the cells that make up the gut lining while working to support a healthy gut barrier. All of this is contained in a delayed-release capsule designed to help reach the colon.
