  "brand_name": "Pace",
  "product_description": "Pace is a group-based personal development service where individuals join weekly sessions with a trained facilitator to discuss life challenges and personal growth. Members are matched with a small group of like-minded people, providing support and fresh perspectives on topics like relationships, work, stress, and life transitions. The service is accessed through their website, where users complete a questionnaire to be matched to a group."
}, Pace is a group of seven like-minded individuals. You meet weekly with a world-class facilitator, and you essentially just work on yourself. It's a space for you to connect with these strangers who are going through similar things in life that you are, whether it be relationship challenges, work, burnout, stress, becoming a new parent. It's a new way to get perspectives on your life that you don't have to burden your friends and family with. It's a new way for you to learn and grow and develop as a person, and connecting with these strangers all over the world allows you to be open and be vulnerable more than you might with your friends and family. Pace is super easy to sign up for. You head to their website, pace.group, take a quick questionnaire. From there, you are matched to a group with seven people. I absolutely love my Pace group, and I would recommend Pace to anybody and everyone I know.
