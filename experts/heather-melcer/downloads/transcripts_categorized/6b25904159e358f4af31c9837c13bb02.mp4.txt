}, What's up guys, I'm Tim, I'm the founder of Broya, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about why I decided to start this brand. For years before I started Broya, I actually started sourcing high quality meats from local farmers about an hour outside of the city. You source directly from the farmer, you're getting everything. You're getting the muscle meats, the steaks, the organs, and the bones. I'm not going to lie, I had no idea what to do with these bones, so they just sat in the bottom of my freezer. And I started doing a bit of research on bone broth, and I started to see that actually one of the best ways to get collagen protein is from bone broth. So I just started making it every single day. I started drinking about two cups every single day, and it was pretty clear to me right away that this was a game changer. Within a couple weeks, I noticed some immediate improvements in my gut health. And that's when Broya was born. Boom! I thought, man, the world needs to know about this. And there was no bone broths being sold in the groceries, at least no high quality ones.
