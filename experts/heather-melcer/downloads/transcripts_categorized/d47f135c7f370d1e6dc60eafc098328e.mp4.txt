{
  "brand_name": "Aesop Face Cream",
  "product_description": "A high-quality facial moisturizer known for its smooth texture and premium ingredients, designed to leave skin feeling exceptionally soft."
}, 3 reasons why I regret buying this Aesop face cream:
1. The texture is too smooth.
2. My skin feels too soft after using it.
3. They use too many high-quality ingredients.
