}, We ran out of food every day. Every day? Yes. So we were sold out for three months. Three and a half years ago, we opened a restaurant first in Seattle. Selfishly, we just wanted to eat our favorite foods. I'm married to Caleb, who's also my co-founder. His favorite food is something called Xinjiang Bao. We had never found a good version of it here in the US. So for the first two weeks, it was so busy. Basically, we got things in order, but then three months after that, COVID hit. And we started to experiment with another item, which was the soup dumpling. So that's actually our e-commerce item, is frozen soup dumplings. So there were a lot of communities on Facebook that were supporting small businesses and just saying like, hey, here's this restaurant if you didn't know about it, and they're open again. That's what we leveraged. And after about a month and a half, we were open as the restaurant again. But now we had an additional line of business that we had started.
