}, Boy, I tell you, we just had a fright. We just chased up a couple white-tailed deer, and Mia just took off like a bolt to the end of her leash. Thank heavens she's got her Tractive on, because if she had pulled that out of my hands, which, because the way they all took off, it could have really happened. Oh, my goodness gracious, what a peace of mind knowing that I could have found her. There's so many things I love about the Tractive. I love the virtual fencing I can create at home, the way we can log all our miles. It's secure, and it's waterproof. It's not coming off. But to me, the peace of mind is so invaluable that if she gets distracted and runs off, that I'm going to be able to find her, because if she's getting a little older, I don't know how good her directions home are. I really am so grateful for my Tractive. It is so comforting to know that no matter where we go, I can have her off leash, and I'll still know where she is if she decides to bolt somewhere.
