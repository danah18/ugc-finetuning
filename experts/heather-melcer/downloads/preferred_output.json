He found that a regular pillow lacked the support he needed to fill the gap between his shoulders and his big head. He woke up sore, unrested, and achy. I feel sore, unrested, and achy. That's when Jay had his great idea. Why not make a pillow in the shape of a cube? And that's how I invented the PillowCube. The PillowCube wasn't a sack of fluff, it was a bed. Designed for your head. It was soft, yet supportive. He would name it PillowCube. I dub thee PillowCube. It was not a cube and the internet would hate this blatant disregard for geometry.

The last session, our facilitator asked us what patterns we were noticing in our lives. I had trouble answering at first because everything feels so unsettled to me right now. But after I shared, she very gently asked me, perhaps my pattern was watering dead plants in my life. The group has moved on to other things and topics, but that question right there has changed how I've looked at everything the past few weeks. So if you need a group of people to connect with who are committed to staying open and curious, I would encourage you to check out PACE groups. I loved how quickly we were able to connect with each other and how invested we became in everyone's stories. And it's not therapy, but it definitely is support in a way that you don't typically find in your traditional work-home-school environments. So check it out.", "4b8f6ab8e3dd49164f586252075e6ee7.mp4": "Hey guys, this is our founder Chris. This story starts when Chris was getting repeatedly sick back in the early 2000s. For years, he did all the things he thought were supposed to keep him healthy. He ate vegetables, stayed active, took all the supplements, but Chris was still getting sick. After spending an entire month and way too much money at a health clinic, Chris discovered the reason he was getting sick was because his body wasn't even absorbing nutrients properly. And that was all thanks to poor gut health. So, working with the best naturopaths, doctors, and medical researchers in the world, Chris created a simple solution. The result was what we now know as AG1. It's the ultimate nutritional drink that provides all the nutrients you need for gut support in just one simple scoop. Drink it once a day and you're done. All of the pieces were falling together, but there was something missing. Something that we just couldn't quite put a finger on. Here we go. What's that? It's TikTok, Bastion. You did it? TikTok.

This is Ritual's Symbiotic Plus. It's actually a three-in-one gut support supplement featuring clinically studied prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics to support microbiome balance. A lot of the time, we only think of probiotics when it comes to gut health, but there are other ingredients like prebiotics and postbiotics that may be lesser known but are equally as important. The prebiotics in Symbiotic Plus support the growth of probiotics. Postbiotic provides fuel to the cells that make up the gut lining while working to support a healthy gut barrier. All of this is contained in a delayed-release capsule designed to help reach the colon.", "548ecc2bfd8a8bbf62bbf25219f4dd81.mp4": "Before Tractive, I really thought that Finley and I were living our best life. But I always got really nervous and full of anxiety when she wandered off too far. And now after Tractive, it's just really helped me build my trust in her and it's deepened our relationship. And I always know where she is. The awesome Tractive features that are most important to me are that it's 100% waterproof, the GPS tracking works worldwide, and in the app it actually updates every two to three seconds, so super accurate. That's super important to me. You can check their activity goals, the battery life lasts for seven days, which is great. And it's really easy to set up virtual fences, so you get a notification as soon as they leave a safe space.", "c1268abe6f337b5745be1d0ef28b991a.mp4": "Here's what I spent this month on ClassPass. As someone on a budget, I'm on the 43 credit plan, which is only $89 a month, and it's such a good deal. First, I used 6 credits on Pilates. Next, I let off some steam in boxing with 8 credits, and it got very sweaty. Then I found my inner zen for 8 credits. I also tried pole dancing, and I wasn't that good, but it was a blast, and it was only 3 credits. Finally, I hit the gym with a friend, so here you start taking a selfie while I ran in the background. We also love hopping in the pool, and all these gym visits were only 12 credits.

Base provides you with links inside of the app to supplements that you can purchase from Amazon, making it easy to order right away.

I talked to my friend who goes in the office and we were kind of talking about some of the main things we look for in a work shoe. I think number one is comfort, especially if you're in a big city. Of course, number two, you want them to be cute. You don't want ugly shoes. I don't think they have to be so cute that you'd wear them when you weren't working, but cute enough that you feel like yourself. And then also trying to figure out what your vibe is. Do you want a little bit of a heel or is it casual enough you can wear a tennis shoe? That's a lot of requirements. We all know I'm very picky. Okay, I screenshotted some and I'm gonna put them on the screen. I like these. I think I kind of like the pointed toe and I think if you want a heel, I feel like this could be a good option. I go back and forth all the time if I like the look of loafers or mules, I think these are called. If I were to get them, I think this would be a good option. Okay, these aren't bad. These are, they look comfortable and they have like a little bit of a heel. Again, if I was to get loafers, I think I would get these. I don't know. Very not my style, but I feel like these are a really good option for the workplace. Oh, these are cute. Sam Edelman. I love the things on the heels. Those look really comfortable. They come in this color too. I like these. I feel like most workplaces have to be close-toed, but if not, any kind of sandal I feel like would work. How do we feel about these? I don't know. They're Target. My friend said these were very like old looking. If you can do an open-toed shoe to work, I think these are so cute.

Oh, my goodness gracious, what a peace of mind knowing that I could have found her. There's so many things I love about the Tractive. I love the virtual fencing I can create at home, the way we can log all our miles. It's secure, and it's waterproof. It's not coming off. But to me, the peace of mind is so invaluable that if she gets distracted and runs off, that I'm going to be able to find her, because if she's getting a little older, I don't know how good her directions home are. I really am so grateful for my Tractive. It is so comforting to know that no matter where we go, I can have her off leash, and I'll still know where she is if she decides to bolt somewhere.", "697f66cee416c58026be0d1e857f1690.mp4": "Want a teeth whitening product that actually works?
