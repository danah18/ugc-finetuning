All right, today's gonna be a good day. I'm gonna sit down here, I'm gonna drink this coffee, and we're gonna get started on that to-do list that's a couple weeks backed up. But it's okay, everyone just says one task at a time. And I'm gonna just do my best, and I'm just gonna wake up and make sure that today goes well, and we're gonna get it done.
