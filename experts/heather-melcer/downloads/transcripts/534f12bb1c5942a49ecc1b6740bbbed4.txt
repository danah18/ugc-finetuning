Things I found on the internet that I can no longer live without. I found this chili crisp on TikTok and I had to give it a try. Oof, that smells good. It's hard to describe the taste, it has garlic for sure, and it's full of these fried aromatics like shallots and black beans that give it this amazing texture. It's definitely spicy, but it also has a really umami flavor that somehow enhances everything I add it to. I like to add them to my favorite dumplings for the extra layer of flavor we all need in our lives. Okay, and the best part? Sichuan chili crisp is vegan, all natural, and has no MSG or artificial flavoring. And Fly By Jing has a badass founder who used to be a chef herself, so you know it's legit. You have to try this out.
