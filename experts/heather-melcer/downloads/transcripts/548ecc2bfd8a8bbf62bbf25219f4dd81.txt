Before Tractive, I really thought that Finley and I were living our best life. But I always got really nervous and full of anxiety when she wandered off too far. And now after Tractive, it's just really helped me build my trust in her and it's deepened our relationship. And I always know where she is. The awesome Tractive features that are most important to me are that it's 100% waterproof, the GPS tracking works worldwide, and in the app it actually updates every two to three seconds, so super accurate. That's super important to me. You can check their activity goals, the battery life lasts for seven days, which is great. And it's really easy to set up virtual fences, so you get a notification as soon as they leave a safe space.
