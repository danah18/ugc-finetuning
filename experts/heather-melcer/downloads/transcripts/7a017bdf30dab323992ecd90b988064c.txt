Bad reviews about PrettyLitter. It absorbs the smell of my cat's pee so well, I forget I have him. It's 99.9% dust-free, so I don't get to clean up all the time anymore. One bag lasts a whole month, which makes it hard to find a reason to go to the pet store. I got a free scooper and litter box, so I had to get rid of my old gross one, which was really sad. Try it for yourself and check out PrettyLitter right now.
