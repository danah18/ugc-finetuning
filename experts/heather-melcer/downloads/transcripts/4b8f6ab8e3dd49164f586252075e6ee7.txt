Hey guys, this is our founder Chris. This story starts when Chris was getting repeatedly sick back in the early 2000s. For years, he did all the things he thought were supposed to keep him healthy. He ate vegetables, stayed active, took all the supplements, but Chris was still getting sick. After spending an entire month and way too much money at a health clinic, Chris discovered the reason he was getting sick was because his body wasn't even absorbing nutrients properly. And that was all thanks to poor gut health. So, working with the best naturopaths, doctors, and medical researchers in the world, Chris created a simple solution. The result was what we now know as AG1. It's the ultimate nutritional drink that provides all the nutrients you need for gut support in just one simple scoop. Drink it once a day and you're done. All of the pieces were falling together, but there was something missing. Something that we just couldn't quite put a finger on. Here we go. What's that? It's TikTok, Bastion. You did it? TikTok.
