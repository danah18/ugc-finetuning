I've got a hot take. Most ski goggles, they're overpriced shit, and there's a reason for that. Two brands, two, own 76% of the goggle market. Not to name any names here, but those brands, they're trying to convince you to buy a pair of goggles for two, three, even four hundred dollars. That's crazy. That's why I started Glade, because we have a vision to create really high quality products at a value price point and deliver them to you in a way that makes sense. In just a few short years, we've amassed tens of thousands of happy customers. Just take a look in the lift line next time you're out skiing, you'll see our stuff everywhere. And there's a reason for that. We've won awards from Outside Magazine, Ski Magazine, Backcountry Magazine, Free Skier, Blister Gear Review, you name it, we've probably won an award from them. And the reason for that is because we cut no corners on construction, no corners on quality, and everything's designed right here in Breckenridge, Colorado. Not to mention, all this gear behind me, in my car right now, that's all backed by our craftsmanship guarantee. Some of this gear behind me right here, these goggles, they do some pretty amazing things. These ones, they change tint automatically depending on the weather. So if it's flat light, bluebird sunny, it doesn't matter, you're going to be able to see the snow perfectly. This helmet that I'm wearing right here comes with a MIPS safety system and it's under $200. That's the best bang for your buck in terms of premium safety you're ever going to find. So click the link somewhere around our video and see for yourself why we're the fastest growing brand in our category. See you on the hill. So if I were you, I'd head to shopglade.com because as you can see, this won't be around for long.
