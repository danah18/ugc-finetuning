100% मैं Relo को recommend करूँगा, उससे restaurant चलाना काफ़ी easy हो जाता है. I still praise Mr. Farid that इतना अच्छा platform लाये है to restaurateurs or F&B line के लिए. Why Relo offers is the best because when I logged in first I think I knew entirely what it was, where to go and what to do without anyone showing me or training me. I think it's streamlined and buttery smooth, there is no issue whatsoever. And training any staff, whether it is new staff, he knows about pet pooja or not, it is very easy to train them with Relo's point system and feedback system. I had not imagined कि इतना scale पे CRM work करता है. I mean seeing a 40% repeat rate. It's like a backbone for any restaurant or a retail outlet where you want to know your customers well. So Relo help us to know our customers. Definitely अगर आप कोई business कर रहे हो, इसमें आप customer को communicate करना चाहती हो और वो आप feedback चाहती हो, data चाहती हो, तो definitely आपको Relo करना चाहिए. Easy है and effective. I suggest Relo for all the new restaurants that are actually coming up because during the initial days, a restaurant would face a really hard time getting the feedback, from capturing the feedback to knowing what the customer had to say and what the customer wants from them. So if they use Relo, it will solve like 90% of their initial problem.
