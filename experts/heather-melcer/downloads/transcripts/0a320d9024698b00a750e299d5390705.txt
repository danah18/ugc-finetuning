I've had three sessions in my PACE group and I love it. The last session, our facilitator asked us what patterns we were noticing in our lives. I had trouble answering at first because everything feels so unsettled to me right now. But after I shared, she very gently asked me, perhaps my pattern was watering dead plants in my life. The group has moved on to other things and topics, but that question right there has changed how I've looked at everything the past few weeks. So if you need a group of people to connect with who are committed to staying open and curious, I would encourage you to check out PACE groups. I loved how quickly we were able to connect with each other and how invested we became in everyone's stories. And it's not therapy, but it definitely is support in a way that you don't typically find in your traditional work-home-school environments. So check it out.
