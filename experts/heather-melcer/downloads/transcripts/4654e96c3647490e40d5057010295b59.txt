Hey guys, welcome back to my review of Pretty Litter. I've had it in my litter box for about a month now, and I love it. It's made of silica gel-based crystals, so it's super absorbent and traps in the odor. This room smells so, so much better after switching to Pretty Litter. And it has this really cool color-changing technology that helps me keep an eye on my cat's health. It alerts me of potential urinary problems. You need to take your cat's litter game to the next level and get some Pretty Litter.
