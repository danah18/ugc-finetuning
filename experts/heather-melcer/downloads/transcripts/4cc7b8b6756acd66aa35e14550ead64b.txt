Why is the pillow square? I'm glad you asked. This is Jay, the inventor of the PillowCube, and this is a substantially more attractive version of Jay we hired to tell you about it. I don't know that I would say substantially. Call me Jaybraham. That's not my name. Jay had a big problem. Put your hand down. He had a huge gap between his head and his bed that no pillow could fill. He found that a regular pillow lacked the support he needed to fill the gap between his shoulders and his big head. He woke up sore, unrested, and achy. I feel sore, unrested, and achy. That's when Jay had his great idea. Why not make a pillow in the shape of a cube? And that's how I invented the PillowCube. The PillowCube wasn't a sack of fluff, it was a bed. Designed for your head. It was soft, yet supportive. He would name it PillowCube. I dub thee PillowCube. It was not a cube and the internet would hate this blatant disregard for geometry. But God bless the internet people, they would love that cube. And the reason was simple. When you uncrank that neck, you align your spine and sleep fully supported. And pain free. Hundreds and thousands of people loved the PillowCube and have said things like, It's literally the most supportive, most comfortable pillow I've ever tried in my life. So I love what they said about that, how it actually does what they say it does. I literally had the best night's sleep. And they did it all without getting paid. And this is not a paid advertisement at all. But it's just a square? Why hasn't anyone done it before? Simple. Big Pillow wants to make a pillow that works for everyone. But by designing a pillow for everyone, they make a pillow that doesn't work perfectly for anyone. But not PillowCube. We're the first to stick it to Big Pillow and start taking care of the side sleepers. PillowCube makes pillows in different sizes designed to fit you and how you sleep. Perfectly.
