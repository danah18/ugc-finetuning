Wondering why you're always so tired? Did you know that there is something called chronic fatigue syndrome? I was so tired of feeling fatigued, so I decided to take the adrenal fatigue test from base. The test showed that I had low testosterone, cortisol. So how do I fix that? Base provides you with links inside of the app to supplements that you can purchase from Amazon, making it easy to order right away. And they gave me an adrenal energy diet, which emphasized foods that restore the appropriate rebalancing of hormones. Base finds the right treatment plan tailored to your needs, and it can all be done within the comfort of your own home. So take control of your health with base.
