Let's do a little day in the life of Maggie. First things first, I grab her tractive off the charger and I put it on. I give her all the pets and a kiss so she knows she needs to come home and then I set her free. And there she goes off for her first adventure of the day. I don't worry about her until I get a notification that she has left the virtual fence, which happens sometimes, but she stays pretty close so I turn on live so I can keep an eye on her. I go outside and I start shouting for her and then she likes to tease me sometimes and just run right along the property line. But eventually when she decides she's ready she comes back home and starts trotting up to the house.
