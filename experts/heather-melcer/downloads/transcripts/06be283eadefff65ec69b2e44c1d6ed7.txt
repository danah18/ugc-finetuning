Breaking news in the dog community, Apple has released another statement warning owners to not put Apple AirTags on their dogs. Vets are also warning owners to not use Apple AirTags to track their pets. Do not panic, there is a way better option to keep tabs on your dog. Fi's Series 3 GPS collar offers live GPS tracking, activity and sleep monitoring, and even sends you escape alerts to your phone directly in real time. It's basically an Apple Watch for your dog. I personally had an Apple AirTag and when I heard this news, I went and got him the blue Fi collar, and not only do I know that my dog is safe, also makes me feel better if I ever let someone watch my dog to be able to monitor where they're at and know if they try to escape. So from dog owner to dog owner, I highly recommend the Fi's Series 3 GPS collar so we can all make sure that our pets are safe.
