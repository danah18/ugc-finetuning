Here are three reasons why I use the Tractive Pet GPS Tracker. It's super compact, easy to charge and easy to pop on my collar. I have tested it in the waves and can confirm it's waterproof and very durable. It has a map for mom to look at my live GPS location since she is so obsessed with me and she can monitor my activity levels too.
