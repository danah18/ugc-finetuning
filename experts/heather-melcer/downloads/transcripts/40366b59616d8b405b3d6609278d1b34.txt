With the help of a Princeton neuroscience professor, a Princeton alumnus specializing in chemical patent law, and a pharmaceutical manufacturer, I invented the first product ever designed to reduce the negative effects of alcohol. The product isn't legit, it doesn't matter. Here's where the BS beaters go. You got every time I said, how much? Like, no, homie don't play that. As a kid that just graduated college, it was a pretty stressful environment. Basically what Mark Cuban does to me is, you're going to debate the science with me, or you can talk about the business, but I'm going to call you a snake oil salesman the whole time. And so obviously, I spent the entire episode debating the science, and I don't think it really worked. So it's pretty funny, you know, this whole episode, Mark basically derailed it. So Brooks, you know what just happened here today? You had a Cuban heist. You might be curious, what happened after? Well, that week was crazy. We probably sold an extra quarter million dollars just from airing on Shark Tank. Fast forward a few years, now we've done about $50 million total revenue. We sold 20 million doses. We're number one in our category on Amazon, 7,004 and five star reviews. And this year, we're launching in some of the largest retailers in the United States. So if you're a health conscious drinker, and you're looking to support your liver and feel better the day after drinking alcohol, then I highly recommend trying Cheers. If you don't feel at least 50% better the next day, we'll give your money back, no questions asked. The easiest way to buy it is from Amazon. We continue to be successful, and we continue to prove Mark wrong. And that makes me really happy.
