The study is important because it shows that exercise can really help improve quality of life and improve healthspan and longevity. The results were really interesting. P-Volv improved strength by 20%, flexibility by 21%, and improved balance and stability by 10%. These are real numbers that show that P-Volv can help women at all life stages improve their quality of life and healthspan long-term.
