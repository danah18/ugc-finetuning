If you're anything like me, you do all the right things. You spend time with your friends and family, you make time for your hobbies, and practice self-care, at least when you have the time. But you feel like something is missing. So I joined a P.A.C.E. group. P.A.C.E. is an online platform that connects a group of seven like-minded individuals along with your facilitator. You meet weekly for 90 minutes to connect and grow as individuals. P.A.C.E. is for people who are going through the typical challenges of life. It is a safe space to share your challenges, struggles, and wins with people who you wouldn't normally cross paths with in your day-to-day environment. They are designed to help you grow and get new perspectives on yourself and your life. We navigate topics such as new life chapters, relationship challenges, and work-life balance and much, much more. P.A.C.E. is private and confidential. It's only $89 per month. It's quick and easy to sign up. Just head over to P.A.C.E. Group and you'll answer a short questionnaire about your personality, life situation, stressors, and your needs. P.A.C.E. will use this information to handpick people for your group. I look forward to connecting with my group every week. I now feel supported, valued, and confident in myself as I take on new life challenges. So if you're ready to make the change you want in your life, try P.A.C.E.
