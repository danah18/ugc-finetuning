This is why it took me so long to start doing therapy. $200 is no joke. I had no insurance and I thought it was way out of my budget. But I found an online mental health service called Cerebral that offers online therapy at a monthly price that I can afford. All I had to do was take a short quiz and their team of professionals found me a therapist who I really connect with. It's so nice to be able to take our meetings from home and to have a judgment-free space to work on my mental health. If you're in this boat, definitely try Cerebral.
