There's golfers and there's app developers, and there's usually not a lot of crossover between those two which is why a lot of golf apps feel like they're clunky, they just don't quite get it. That's what I love about Leaderboard and what I think makes it different. It's made by developers who are golfers and they love golf. And I think that's a difference you can really feel in the app.
