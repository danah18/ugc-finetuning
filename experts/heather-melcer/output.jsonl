And the reason for that is because we cut no corners on construction, no corners on quality, and everything's designed right here in Breckenridge, Colorado. Not to mention, all this gear behind me, in my car right now, that's all backed by our craftsmanship guarantee.

He found that a regular pillow lacked the support he needed to fill the gap between his shoulders and his big head. He woke up sore, unrested, and achy. I feel sore, unrested, and achy. That's when Jay had his great idea. Why not make a pillow in the shape of a cube? And that's how I invented the PillowCube. The PillowCube wasn't a sack of fluff, it was a bed. Designed for your head. It was soft, yet supportive. He would name it PillowCube. I dub thee PillowCube. It was not a cube and the internet would hate this blatant disregard for geometry. But God bless the internet people, they would love that cube. And the reason was simple. When you uncrank that neck, you align your spine and sleep fully supported. And pain free. Hundreds and thousands of people loved the PillowCube and have said things like, It's literally the most supportive, most comfortable pillow I've ever tried in my life. So I love what they said about that, how it actually does what they say it does. I literally had the best night's sleep. And they did it all without getting paid.

You're getting the muscle meats, the steaks, the organs, and the bones. I'm not going to lie, I had no idea what to do with these bones, so they just sat in the bottom of my freezer. And I started doing a bit of research on bone broth, and I started to see that actually one of the best ways to get collagen protein is from bone broth. So I just started making it every single day. I started drinking about two cups every single day, and it was pretty clear to me right away that this was a game changer. Within a couple weeks, I noticed some immediate improvements in my gut health. And that's when Broya was born. Boom! I thought, man, the world needs to know about this.
