Canada has a housing problem. There's just not enough houses for everyone. The government plans to build 350,000 homes annually, and that number just dropped down to 215,000 in January. Honestly, it's hard keeping up to date with all the changes in the market like this, and that's exactly why I read The Peak. It's a daily email newsletter that helps me keep up to date on the Canadian business, tech, and finance markets. There's no fluff, no politics, and no bias, so I get to read the news that matter the most to me without the headache of those traditional news channels. And it only takes me about five minutes a day to read, but go ahead and check it out for yourself at readthepeak.com.
