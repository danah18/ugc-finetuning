Here are three ways Rise improved my uncontrollable stomach issues, stamina, and stress. I've been using Rise mushroom coffee and it's been doing wonders for me. It's packed with amazing mushrooms like turkey tail, which helps protect your gut from the common ailments plaguing women of all ages. Bloating, inflammation, horrible breakouts, and constant cramping. I mean, it got so bad that I couldn't even enjoy a nice dinner without holding my stomach in pain. You also have reishi, which helps reduce anxiety and stress. Now, no matter how chaotic the world around me is, the world inside feels calm and relaxed. And then you have cordyceps, which helps me keep up with all of life's craziness without falling behind. I come home and still have the energy to enjoy the sun and do the things I love, which is such a breath of fresh air. All of that and three more mushrooms I didn't even mention in a single scoop of Rise mushroom coffee. No special skincare routine or expensive probiotic supplements. Grab a bag today. You'll love yourself for it, I promise.
