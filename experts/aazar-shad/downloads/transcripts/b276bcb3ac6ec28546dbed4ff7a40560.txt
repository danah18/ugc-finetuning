I love cardboard. It's got so much flavor. The texture once you put the milk on it is so delicious. And there is so much variety to choose from. Don't be like Susan. Eat cereal instead. Cereal doesn't need to be boring or super sugary. It can be full of protein, have zero sugar, and come in delicious flavors that's gonna remind you of your childhood. So don't eat cardboard, recycle it. So head to the Cereal website to try them out today.
