I tried everything to fix my hygiene, but these just made me smell like a chemical factory because they're all packed with harsh ingredients, which dries out your skin and clogs your pores. But I kept seeing this natural deodorant all over TikTok. It's all natural and actually safe to use compared to the brands we normally use. It keeps all the harsh chemicals at bay while still keeping you fresh all day long. We love Dr. Squatch. No streaks or stains that get on your shirt when you apply it. It's also really good for your skin because it's got jojoba oil, which is moisturizing, makes your skin nice and soft, and it has a super smooth glide so it doesn't get your pits all wet and gross and icky. It comes in eight naturally derived sets. Oh, that smells like some good wood right there. Super good. My fianc√© always smells so good, so one day I decided why not try a little bit of his deodorant. And now I'm hooked. And Dr. Squatch has so many other amazing products too, like bars of soap that naturally exfoliate while still hydrating, repairing, and soothing sensitive skin, lotion that is lightweight and non-greasy, and they also have shampoo and conditioner. Not that two-in-one stuff. Head over to DrSquatch.com to start turning your pits right. DrSquatch.com
