I finally found an app that will help me be better with my money, and it's called The Peak Money. It wasn't luck, the lottery, or an inheritance. And I didn't deprive myself of having fun, too. What I did was educate myself about personal finance and develop a system that allowed me to save, earn, and invest more than I ever had. I signed up to The Peak Money, which gives me twice-weekly tips of earning, saving, investing, and so much more. The best part? It only takes five minutes to read. Trust me, you need The Peak Money in your inbox, and you're only a click away.
