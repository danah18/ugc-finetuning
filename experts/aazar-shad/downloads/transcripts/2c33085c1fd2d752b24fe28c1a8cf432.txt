My company added Matter to Slack, and our company culture and recognition became so much better. Matter lets you recognize and reward your teammates for their hard work, and we love using it. In Slack, you can send kudos to deserving coworkers in just a few seconds. It felt so good being recognized for my hard work. So we started using their Feedback Friday feature, and now over 50% of our team sends kudos every week. And the best part? It only took a minute to set up and use. Add Matter to your Slack or Microsoft Teams for free today!
