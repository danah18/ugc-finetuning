How mushrooms changed my life. I was drinking tons of coffee. I was jittery, I was anxious, and I met more and more people who had a similar relationship to caffeine. So I ended up swapping it out for masala chai. I added lion's mane for focus and cognitive function, chaga and reishi for immune support, cordyceps for physical performance, cacao for flavor, all organic, with one-seventh of caffeine of coffee, and we would love for you to try it.
