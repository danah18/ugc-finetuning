Hi parents! What if I told you that your child needs to stop memorizing notes to prepare for the exams? Give me one minute and I will tell you why. Did you know that if your child were to blindly memorize notes for the exams, they are likely to score C and below? You might be surprised to know that, after hours of hard work, they might not even understand what they're learning and that they might do badly in the exam. Here is why. I'm Dr. Christina. I'm a study coach. After helping more than 3,000 students to improve their grades, what I found out is that top students study very differently from the others. I've seen so many students do badly in exams by blindly memorizing. The worst thing is they could go into this vicious cycle of working really hard and not getting the grades they want, and finally giving up on studying. But it doesn't have to be like that. By teaching students the right study techniques and systems that are used by the top 10% of students, I have helped many students improve their grades dramatically.
