Should we be scared of AI? By 2025, AI will have replaced one of two jobs, and the scary thing is, it's going to create what we call a critical point. A critical point is like a crossroad, where the action you take at that moment will significantly shape your future. And as we navigate this AI revolution, there will be two types of people that emerge, those who embrace and leverage AI, and those who won't.
