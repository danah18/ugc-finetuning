I get asked all the time if I know how to speak French. And I will say when I moved to Geneva a year and a half ago I knew nothing. Like I couldn't even say hello. But being able to speak the native language here is super important to me. So last May I signed up for a two month long Lingoda Sprint which was 30 French classes over two months. I needed something really intense to whip my language skills into shape and it definitely did. I love it and right now I'm halfway through the A1.1 level. Yay! If you're looking to learn a new language you should definitely check it out. Anyway I'm headed to get coffee at a new spot here in Geneva and so I thought this would be a really good opportunity to test my French skills. Bonjour! Bonjour! Je voudrais un latte s'il vous plaît. Un latte avec du lait normal? Ah oui normal, merci. Voilà. Merci! Gardez la monnaie. Au revoir. Ah that wasn't so bad. We definitely have a long way to go but you know I think I'm off to a good start. Au revoir!
