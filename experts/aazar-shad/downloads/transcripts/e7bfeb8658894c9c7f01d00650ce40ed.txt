Okay, so let me tell you all about this secret my husband revealed to me. It's called 1440 and it's this daily digest that covers the news in an unbiased way. He got me to sign up to it also. It's amazing. I've literally stopped watching regular TV channel news because it always felt like it had an agenda. And it's just a five minute read. I'm literally up to date on the news so quickly, which means I save so much time now. You guys need to sign up to it. It's free and you can unsubscribe if you don't like it. Go check it out.
