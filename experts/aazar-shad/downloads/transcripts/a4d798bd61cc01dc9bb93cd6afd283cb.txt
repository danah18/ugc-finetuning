I've been using AI to help me get my work done so much faster. Let me explain. I found out about these productivity apps from The Peak, a daily email newsletter. They cover everything from business and tech news to economic insights that's made specifically for Canadians. It's an easy read, straight to the point, and I love how conversational it is. Oh, and did I mention it's completely free? Plus, they already have 125,000 subscribers, so you know it's legit. I literally work half the time I used to at work, and my boss doesn't even know. So go sign up and check out The Peak.
