My daughter enrolled in Beta Camp. She was not sure what path she wanted to follow when she would graduate, if she wanted to go in a science field or a medical field or a business field. She had a brief taste of business through DECA, which was an extracurricular program. So her friend talked to her about Beta Camp, and she learned so much from this camp. She learned about business, she learned all the different vocabulary of business, she learned how to do a startup, connecting with kids from another country. They learned to make it a successful startup, they received lots of feedback on it. The instructors are incredible, the coaching is incredible, and I highly recommend this for anybody. It has completely put her in a position to be confident moving forward with her university studies.
