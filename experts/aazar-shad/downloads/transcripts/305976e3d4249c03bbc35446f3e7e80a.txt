One of my favorite types of boring businesses? A car wash. Why? Because you can print money with soap, a little water, they got some aroma therapy, they got some towels, a little air pressure. Every one of those things costs you, the consumer, a few quarters and makes these guys tens of thousands of dollars a month with zero employees. That's why I love boring businesses.
