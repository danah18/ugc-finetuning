Y'all have a sibling that's constantly trying to one-up you? That's my older brother. Not only has he started running more, but he switched up his breakfast to this high-protein oatmeal shake. He's been loving the convenience and flavors of Oats Overnight, but also the nutrition. It seems like the perfect fuel for a run. The idea of drinking oatmeal was a little weird at first, and it took some convincing, but now I'm hooked. He even got me to start being more active too. Running can be hard, but there's no reason to make breakfast hard too.
