Okay, I've been stuck all morning trying to think about a way to talk about my daily newsletter. Racking my brain and finding cool creative ideas and I just decided to pick up the phone and just tell you. My newsletter is called Stand the F*** Out. I send it Monday to Friday. Every day there's a little essay that I send you. It's either a tip, an example, a little story to help make your business stand the f*** out. There are more than 10,000 folks who joined the list. Yes, people do say subscribe, but I'm going to say it's not for everyone. It's really, really for business owners who are stuck in crowded markets and don't know how to differentiate. It's for you if you're a bit of a weirdo and you want to do something different but you're not too sure how because everyone talks about the why but not about the how. It's for you if you're willing to take some risks and play inside the category you're in or the industry. That's it really. So you just click on sign up. It brings you to the page. You can read more testimonials and then subscribe. I'll see you on the other side.
