Listen, I just hit my first 100k in savings, and I want to tell you my secret so you can do it too. It wasn't luck, the lottery, or an inheritance. And I didn't deprive myself of having fun, too. What I did was educate myself about personal finance and develop a system that allowed me to save, earn, and invest more than I ever had. I signed up to The Peak Money, which gives me twice-weekly tips of earning, saving, investing, and so much more. The best part, it only takes five minutes to read. Trust me, you need The Peak Money in your inbox, and you're only a click away.
