This is what your dishwasher looks like after one year. It's a colony of billions of mold and bacteria living deep inside your dishwasher that not only make your dishes cloudy and dirty, but can cause serious health issues if left untreated. The only solution was to disassemble your washer, soak it in bleach and hand clean every nook and cranny which can take hours. It wasn't until 2021 that scientists developed a solution. It was invented by a prominent but frustrated scientist. No matter how much his family washed their dishes, they kept noticing their dishes were coming out foggy or just plain dirty. One day he had a crazy idea. He put a waterproof camera in his dishwasher to see what was happening, and when he saw the footage, he was blown away. A greenish black substance was washing up from inside the washing machine and onto his dishes. It wasn't until he examined the dish under a microscope that he realized it was still covered in mold particles. Not just any mold. It was black mold that can be ingested into the bloodstream, causing headaches, memory loss, and fatigue, to name a few. He looked online for solutions, but each one was either ineffective or contained dangerous chemicals that could do more harm than good. So he took the problem back to his lab and developed a solution. He named it Fogo, a brilliant new formula that melts away all bacteria and mold and leaves behind an invisible seal, making it hard to grow back in the future. It's a patented formula that deep cleans your washing machine at a microscopic level. Just place one tablet in an empty dishwasher and run it on a normal cycle. Each tablet expands to create three gallons of all-natural antibacterial foam that deep cleans at a microscopic level. Each packet has six tablets that will last up to six months. It even works on your sink disposal. After seeing how well it worked, he started selling the product online. At first, he relied exclusively on word of mouth. What he didn't expect was for it to go viral on social media, with thousands of customers posting their before and after pictures using his product.
