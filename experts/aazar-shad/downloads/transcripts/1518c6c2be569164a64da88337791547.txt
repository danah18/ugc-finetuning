Funny enough, my mom actually found BetaCamp and she told me about it and I was like, this sounds ridiculous. I don't know what the heck this is. So she sent me a few links. She set me up to have a call with Salman. And I was like, all right, I'll see if it's legit or not. And then after having that call with Salman, I was like, oh, this is actually legit. I'm really interested. Let's move on to the next steps. She was like, you get to make your own startup and you get to meet a bunch of like minded people. And this is kind of what that's what I've been like talking about and preaching about for a while. I was like, I want to meet a bunch of people who are have a similar mindset to me, who are working in like the business or entrepreneurial world. And I found it. If you want to create a real startup and pitch it to VCs, join BetaCamp today.
