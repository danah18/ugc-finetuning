I personally get so overwhelmed with how many different creams and serums and moisturizers that there are on the market. How are you supposed to know what's right for your skin? That's why I literally screamed when Pro's launched custom skincare. Starting with wet skin, just need two pumps of my cleanser, emulsify it in my hands, just massage it into my skin in circular motions, and then rinse. The next step in my routine is my custom serum. Two drops is all you need. I swear when I use this, it just makes me feel like I have a protected soft cushion on my skin. The last final step is the moisturizer. A little goes a very long way, so I honestly don't even need that much. Rub this in, and that's literally the end of my skincare routine. So easy, and I didn't have to do any guesswork, so it's a 10 out of 10 for me.
