How many of you would at least on occasion like to be out of the relationship you're in? Relational intelligence is the set of skills that we bring to knowing how to live our relationships. And I prefer it to emotional intelligence. I've been practicing psychotherapy for over 35 years, working primarily with couples and families. Would you say, coming out of your childhood, that you were more in need of connection and protection or more in need of freedom and individuality? Everybody wants connection and everybody needs separateness. You talk to me about a problem that you're having and I register it like I have to do something. And how many of you have heard yourself say, I don't want you to fix it, I just want you to hear it. Listening is plenty of doing. Relational intelligence is the key to our sociability. It's an essential tool for living in this world. I'm Esther Perel and this is Masterclass.
