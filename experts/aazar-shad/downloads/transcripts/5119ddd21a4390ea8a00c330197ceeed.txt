Hi, my name is Shane and I'm a teacher, not an actor, and I lost 65 pounds making a lot of smoothies in my BlendJet. I knew I wanted to lose weight and I wasn't sure what I needed to do to lose the weight. I was really unhappy and in my after picture, it showed really how happy I was after losing all the weight. It made a big change in my life by just replacing my school lunches with smoothies in my BlendJet. I would put the kids down for a nap, put some protein powder and some fruit in my BlendJet, and I'm so blind that I can blend it up during that time. One of the hardest things with my old blender was cleaning it, and with BlendJet, they say it cleans itself and it really does. All you need to do is put in some water, put a drop of soap in, turn it on, and it cleans itself. I charge my BlendJet with a USB charger. It's very convenient. It only takes an hour, and I get about 15 blends per charge. Because our BlendJets are so beautiful and our family has them in all different colors, we leave them out on the counter, and it's a reminder to have a nice smoothie every day. Don't let the small size of a BlendJet fool you. This thing has a lot of power. I'm a schoolteacher. I'm not an actor. In fact, I'm taking time after work in my classroom to do this for you. If it's something that you're thinking about and you're listening to this and you're contemplating, how can I do it? How can I lose the weight? Give BlendJet a try. I love my BlendJet, and you're going to love it too. You can get your BlendJet exclusively at BlendJet.com.
