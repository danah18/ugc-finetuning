}, Oh my god, you guys. You're not going to believe it, but I just stepped off the scale and I am 29 pounds down. That's right. I lost 29 pounds and no, I was not dying. I've tried that and I hate it. I've tried supplements. I've tried workouts. I even went to my general practitioner and nothing worked. You want to know why? Because my hormones were out of whack. They literally switched off my body's ability to lose weight. You want to know how I know? Because I learned a simple hormone balancing trick from my friend. The results can't be more obvious. I mean, look at this. 117 pounds. I haven't weighed that or been this light in eight years. So if you struggle too with losing weight, it very well could be due to hormonal chaos. But you don't have to guess. You can take this short and simple survey provided by health experts at Happy Mammoth. I took the free survey and it gave me all the answers that I needed.
