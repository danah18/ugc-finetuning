}, If you're struggling with lower back pain and sciatica, it's most likely due to a herniated disc or a compressed spine caused by years of hard work, prolonged sitting, bad posture, and damaging tension on your vertebrae. This causes your spinal discs to squeeze out of place, which puts pressure on your nerves, leading to that sharp pain in your lower back and down one or both of your legs. Millions of people suffer from this every day. Is it something that we can fix? Well, if we gave our overworked vertebrae a break to relax and decompress, they would stop putting pressure on inflamed nerves and discs and start healing. So, how do we make this happen? Painkillers and expensive chiropractor sessions do offer some relief, but unfortunately, it's only temporary and the pain comes back just as it was before. So, in search of a more effective, long-term fix, we decided to get in touch with a team of top chiropractors that worked on a solution to efficiently eliminate the root cause of pain and release all the damaging pressure in your spine. They revealed to us a completely new device that they built with the help of a company called Acemen, which helped thousands of their patients completely get rid of their back pain and sciatica. This is the Refresh Back Stretcher, a sturdy accessory that uses lumbar traction to comfortably stretch your spine at just the right angle while massaging and rehabilitating your back muscles using cleverly designed acupuncture ridges. It was built to support any body weight for any gender at any age. Simply lying down on it for just 10 minutes a day restores the natural curvature of your back, corrects your posture, and decompresses your spinal discs and nerves, giving them time to breathe and repair. The whole point of this device is to help your spine recover from years of damage and bad posture and get rid of all pain and inflammation for good. Another amazing thing is that it can also be used to alleviate pain in your neck, thus reducing tension headaches and migraines. 92% of the patients who tried the Refresh Stretcher felt relief from chronic sciatica, back pain, or neck pain after the first use and completely got rid of all discomfort in as little as 6 to 8 days. Here's what people experienced. Hi, my name's Steve and I've suffered for a long time with lower back pain, sometimes debilitating. I've tried painkillers, I've gone to the chiropractor, and I've even been advised that I might need surgery someday. Then my cousin recommended this to me, the Refresh Back Stretcher. And you know what? I thought, hey, I'll give it a shot. And the pain went significantly down after my first use. I went on to use this for a whole week every day. Didn't miss a day.
