}, Hey Georgie! Hey Georgie! Hey Georgie! Hey Georgie! Just wanted to welcome you to the team with this little video. That's just how we do things here at John Analytics. I video you, and you video me back, and we do it with Descript. You need to capture your screen while recording yourself? Descript does that. Replace your background with something more fun? I prefer the cold void of outer space. Then edit all the blather out of your videos, because my time is very precious. Use a template to get it ready for the world. Got it Georgie? Well I expect to see some really great videos from you. I wonder what Georgie does here?
