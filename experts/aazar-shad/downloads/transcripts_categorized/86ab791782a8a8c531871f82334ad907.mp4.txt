}, Worth it or not? I've been seeing Asfedy's Love Every Toys all over social media, so I wanted to try them out to see if it's worth the price tag, because they're not cheap. Okay, so first thoughts right off the bat, these toys are super impressive. They're built to last, and they're so adorable. Our little product tester loved every single one of these toys. Unlike a lot of her other toys, these challenged her and kept her attention for a very long time. I like that some of the toys are a little too advanced for her, so she can grow with the kit for at least a few more months. Even then, though, she still found ways to have fun with the advanced ones. In her own way. So I definitely see why these are a bit expensive, but I have to say, it's definitely worth every penny.
