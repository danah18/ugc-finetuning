}, My boss thought I hired an executive assistant, but I actually just paid 62 cents a day for Motion. I feel like I work 12-hour days and still get nothing done. That's when I found Motion. Motion is an AI personal assistant that saves me two hours of work every day. No more forgotten tasks. No more missed deadlines. No more manually rescheduling. The AI does it all for you. It's the first time in five years that I'm finishing work before 6 p.m. Seriously, my boss thought I hired an executive assistant, but really I just pay 62 cents a day for Motion. Six months ago, I thought I would be laid off, but now I'm actually closer to a promotion. Try it for free. You will notice a difference. Save time with Motion.
