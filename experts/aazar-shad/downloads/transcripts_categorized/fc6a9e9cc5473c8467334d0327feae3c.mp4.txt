}, Webinars are live, but is your audience alive? In this economy to thrive, a better experience you must contrive. I've seen a better way. One where, before you take to the stage, you get a landing page. Now that's really sage, for sign-ups to gauge, en route to engage with polls and Q&A. Wanna talk branded experience? Hence, let's commence. This is your brand, no one else's. See this? It's a city. Hey, it's a party. Hip, hip, hooray! Is that for me? Crowd reactions? Yay! And by the way, these notifications slay. Is that a group chat? No way! Oh, and anyone can join. From the office, the phone, a cafe, or even home. Now, it's time to talk content. Yours is quite an accomplishment. And it's not going anywhere with automatic publishing to the same URL. You'll be raking in leads, isn't that swell? So, welcome to the new Banar. No more of that Borenar. The when's that, what's that, where's that, Leidenar. That was just a sneak peek. But if you're interested, I peek. Then come on, click!
