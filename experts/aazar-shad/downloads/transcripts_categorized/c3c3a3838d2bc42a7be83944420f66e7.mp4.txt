}, Here are the three reasons why I switched to a natural cold process soap. When I went on their website, I couldn't believe they had so many options. You can really see the coffee grounds. Ooh, yeah. It's built different. Like why didn't I just do this before? Made from natural oils, sustainably sourced, this shit will make you smell amazing and it cleans you just as well. Joe Body Wash is garbage. What are you doing overthinking it? Just go and try out some Dr. Squatch. You'll thank me later.
