}, This is what my wallet looks like after 10 years. Pretty sad, right? That's why I ditched it and opted for the Ridge Wallet. Now, not only is my new wallet incredibly sleek and good-looking, but it's built to last. High-quality materials that look brand new after a year of use and abuse, and I couldn't be happier. They also offer a 99-day risk-free trial, so if I didn't like it, I could have just sent it right back. But you know what I did instead? Bought another.
