}, So I lost my husband very suddenly six years ago. And fortunately for me, I had done a significant amount of somatic work. As a student of the work, you also become a patient. And it was the first time in my life, and I attribute most of this to the somatic work, it was the first time in my life I was able to stay connected, and I let people support myself. And I truly believe it's because at that point, I had done so much work to build my body as a safe container.
