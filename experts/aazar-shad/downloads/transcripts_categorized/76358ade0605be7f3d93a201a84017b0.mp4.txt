}, I'm kind of a weirdly shaped dude, but this just squares me out perfectly. It turns my man boobs, makes it look like pecs. It's a 2X. Look how slim this is. Sexy as hell in this damn thing. They're stretchy. They're forgiving. They're made out of high quality material. The fit is great. Nice and tight on the arms. Great around the midsection to hide that dad bod. This feels and looks so good. This is one of my favorite shirts. You throw them in the dryer, they don't shrink. I love them for that. This is a designer type shirt, like a fraction of that price. This is a steal. Not even 20 bucks for these t-shirts? It's insane. Dude, I bought 15 of them. For the price point, you can't beat them. Go get yours today.
