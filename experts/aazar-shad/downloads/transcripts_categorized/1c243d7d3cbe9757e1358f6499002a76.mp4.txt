  "product_description": "JavaSock is a reusable sleeve designed to fit around various sizes of iced coffee cups from popular coffee shops like Dunkin', Starbucks, and McCafe. It prevents condensation from forming on the outside of your cup, keeping your hands and surfaces dry while also adding a cute and stylish touch."
}, I swear I get this question all the time, so let's talk about what JavaSock fits. Your small JavaSock is going to fit a small Dunkin' super well, and it's going to fit your grande Starbucks. What you're looking for is like a flat bottom here. You don't want this rolling all around, and you want a little bit of space between the lip and the lip of the sleeve here. Medium JavaSock, medium Dunkin', that's going to fit super well, and sort of like your medium convenience store drinks and your medium McCafe. And then your large, the seam is different here, so the seam kind of matches up with the large Dunkin', and this will fit super perfectly. And there you go. Okay, I hope that helped. Now I have three coffees to drink. I no longer have to deal with puddles on my desk or in my cup holder while wrapping gross wet napkins around my cup to try and get it to stop sweating. Look, I may be a hot mess sometimes, but my iced coffee will not be. Look how freaking cute this is! It's amazing.
