}, I was diagnosed with ADHD at 39 years old, but when I was diagnosed, I felt like I had a lot to learn. And that's why I'm loving the Inflow app. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I'm loving all the modules. After you finish the modules, you can go on to the challenges. And the challenges are broken down into habits and tasks that you can do throughout your day and implement into your routine. I love that in the Inflow app, there's that community tab. Inflow asks a question each day, and the users get to answer. You can reply back to people or just simply scroll and be like, yeah, I feel that way too. Like there's comfort that comes along with it. So thank you, Inflow.
