}, This is your sign not to get a ceramic pan. Ceramic pans don't last long, chip around the rim, and stain super easily. That's why I am totally obsessed with Hexclad. You get the performance of stainless steel and the convenience of a nonstick pan. Plus, it's completely non-toxic. It's metal utensil safe, dishwasher safe, can go right into the oven, and comes with a lifetime warranty. If Gordon Ramsay uses these pans at home, then you know that they're legit.
