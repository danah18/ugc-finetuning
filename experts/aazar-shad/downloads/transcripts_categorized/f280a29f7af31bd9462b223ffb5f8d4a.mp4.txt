}, Most bowls are round. Not every breakfast is well-rounded. Look at them. They have a sense of humor. Oh, I'm in love. I'm obsessed. I've been seeing Magic Spoon all over TikTok, and it's right. Magic Spoon has all the flavors you could want. Cocoa, peanut butter, frosting, and fruity. Look at this. Oh, there's more. Look at this. Oh, look at this spoon. Look at this bowl. I didn't even know this kind of bowl existed. Look at this. It is funfetti confetti. This spoon is everything. You can get the perfect milk to cereal ratio. Look at this. I think what basically Magic Spoon is saying is breakfast needs to be a party. The moment of truth. You want some? I'll take the first bite. I feel like a kid again. What more could you ask for? I couldn't ask for more. I can't even talk because I'm eating cereal.
