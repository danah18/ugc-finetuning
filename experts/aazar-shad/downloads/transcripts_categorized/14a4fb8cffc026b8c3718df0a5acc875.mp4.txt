}, Three habits that cause stubborn blackheads. Number one, touching your face. When you touch your face, the dirt and germs from your hand transfers onto your face and that can cause more blackheads to form. Number two, not taking your makeup off before bed. We're all guilty of it. After a long night out, taking your makeup off is the last thing on your mind. But if you don't, the makeup will settle into your pores and this might be the reason for your blackheads. And number three, not using the right skincare products. Contrary to popular belief, not all skincare products are formulated to help treat blackheads. That's why one-size-fits-all skincare is not the best option. For skincare that actually works wonders for treating your blackheads, try Curology. Curology is custom skincare that's personalized to your specific skin needs. Just take the quiz online about your skin needs and goals and then your custom skincare routine will be shipped right to your front door. Seriously, go check out Curology like right now.
