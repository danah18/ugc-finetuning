}, They laughed when I ordered this knee massager. Now they ask me where I got it. If you're struggling with knee pain, it means that your cartilage cushioning your knee joint is wearing down. This causes clicking, throbbing, instability, and pain. Simple everyday activities like driving, getting up and down stairs, getting up and out of a chair, and sleeping become incredibly uncomfortable. And the worst part is the feeling that life is passing you by, affecting you and your loved ones. However, the unavoidable problem with knee pain is that your knee's cartilage wears away as you age. This and lack of blood flow causes pain and inflammation. The tricky part? Your knees need movement to stimulate blood circulation, which aids in healing, reduces inflammation, and ultimately eliminates pain. But we all know that when we have knee pain, the last thing you want to do is move and put strain on your hurting knee. Luckily, one of the most successful orthopedists specializing in treating arthritis teamed up with Neuro, a US-based startup. Together with Neuro, he designed a breakthrough knee massager that solves this problem. The secret to the FDA-cleared Neuro knee massager is a unique combination of the three most effective treatments for arthritis. One, red light therapy. Two, heat therapy. Three, massage therapy. Red light therapy helps collagen production. Collagen makes up 85% of your knee's cartilage. Increasing collagen production helps to reverse the damage to cartilage in your knees. Heat therapy loosens the muscles around and inside the knee. It stimulates blood flow. This allows more blood, oxygen, and nutrients to be delivered to the injured tissue. Better blood circulation results in recovery and healing. Massage therapy relaxes tight muscles and tissue. Your knee pain is replaced with a feeling of bliss and relief. So you can get back to squatting, jogging, getting up and down stairs, and driving, completely free of knee pain. Not to mention the real benefits of getting back to living your best life, happy and fulfilled. The best part? It's so simple to use. You just slide it onto your painful knee, push the on button, and enjoy one of the many available programs. Over the course of the year, our customers save on average of $3,428 in physical therapist appointments, painkillers, and other knee pain treatments. Hear from Steven, who is just days away from a knee surgery when he found out about the Neuro Knee Massager. My wife saw an ad for the Neuro Knee Massager, and she wanted to avoid my knee surgery at all costs. So after doing a little bit of research and seeing all the positive reviews, we decided to give it a try. Take it from me, this thing literally saved my life. After using it for just one week, I canceled my surgery and continue using it to this day. The Neuro Knee Massager turned the clock back on my knees. It literally gave me my life back. Now I can enjoy the things I used to love, like long walks and cycling and jogging with my wife. Thank you, Neuro. Here's Karen, 54, who loves to do yoga and enjoys family activities whenever she can. Honestly, I was at rock bottom. My knees had gotten so painful that I had to stop doing all the things I love to do. I couldn't even stretch. I had problems getting into my car. I mean, I know I'm not 20 anymore, but I'm also not 80 either. I used painkillers. I mean, they're great for short-term relief, but they're addictive and they have a lot of negative side effects. I tried going to physical therapy too, and that's great as well, but they're so expensive. And I had to drive like an hour just to get to every appointment. I mean, I was desperate. I really needed help. And that's when I saw a Facebook ad for the Neuro Massager. It promised a lot, and all the reviews seemed to confirm that it was indeed a great product. So, on the website, they had a 90-day results or refund guarantee. So, I decided, well, what have I got to lose? So, I gave it a chance. And after I called Catherine from their customer service to confirm that this refund guarantee was real, I pulled the trigger and ordered two massagers for my knees. Well, let me just say, these things are miracle workers. It's been two weeks, and my knee massage is now my favorite part of the entire day. My knee pain is gone, and I'm looking forward to the family hike that we've got planned for this weekend. You know, anyone out there who's got knee pain, you know, if I can do this, you can do it too. So, go ahead and get your life back. You heard it. Neuro offers a 90-day results or refund guarantee. No questions asked. That means if you don't get relief from knee pain or you simply don't like the product, you get a full refund, and you don't even need to return the product. Last time I checked, they were sold out because of a special $200 discount. So, if they're still available, I recommend getting yours before they sell out again.
