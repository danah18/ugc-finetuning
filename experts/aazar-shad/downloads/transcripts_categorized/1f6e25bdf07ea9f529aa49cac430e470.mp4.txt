  "brand_name": "Future-Proof Formula (possibly by Curology or a similar skincare brand)",
  "product_description": "A customizable skincare treatment formula designed to target and treat acne, breakouts, clogged pores, redness, blackheads, and signs of aging; may contain tretinoin to help prevent acne and reduce early signs of aging."
}, So today we're going to be testing out the custom formula versus the future-proof formula on both sides of my skin. So starting off with the custom formula on the right side of my face, the benefits of this one is that it targets and treats acne, helps treat breakouts, clogged pores, whiteheads, redness, and blackheads. So now on to my holy grail skincare product. This is the future-proof formula and this prevents acne and signs of aging. In my formula it actually has tretinoin which is supposed to help with early signs of aging which is definitely something I'm looking for in my skincare products.
