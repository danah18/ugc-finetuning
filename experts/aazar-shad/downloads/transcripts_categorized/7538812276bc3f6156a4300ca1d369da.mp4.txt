}, Hi, I'm Drew Manning, and I'm a personal trainer that intentionally gained 75 pounds and then lost it so that I could better help people like you lose weight. I'm a huge fan of BlendJet. I use it multiple times per day for my coffee, for my pre-workout, for my daughter's smoothies. One of my favorite parts of the day is just turning it on. So whether you're doing keto, paleo, vegan, vegetarian, it doesn't really matter. BlendJet fits into all those categories and makes all of those lifestyles way more convenient. So one of the things that impressed me with the BlendJet was how powerful it is. I could throw in ice, I could throw in frozen berries, and this thing did the job on all of them. Probably one of the best features that I love about the BlendJet is how easy it is to clean. It's the convenience of it. All the parents out there or people that are pressed for time will love this feature the most. So one of the cool things about the BlendJet is the USB charger, and you can bring this thing with you anywhere you go, and you can get up to 15 blends in one charge. I love that BlendJet has all these amazing colors and patterns and different styles so each person can find one that fits them and their style. So one of the biggest takeaways from my Fit2Pet Fit experience that I've done, I can honestly say I have developed so much more empathy for those that struggle. Transformation is not just about losing weight. It's not just about transforming your body. It's also about transforming your mind. What are you waiting for? Why are you still here?
