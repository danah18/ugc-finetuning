}, Woke up tired, and like every other day, my bonnet's fallen off. Quick check of my daily readiness score, which shows me just how tired I am. Ah, there's my bonnet! And as my score is low today, I'm just going to take it easy peasy, lemon squeezy. I'm still getting out for a little walk, saying hello to the cows. Hello! Picked up some fresh ingredients for my nourishing lunch. Adding crisps here because hashtag balance. So now it's time for some evening yoga, personally recommended by my Fitbit Premium membership, based on my score today. Ten minute flow to get ready for bed, and that's me done for the day, because let's face it, not every day can be leg day.
