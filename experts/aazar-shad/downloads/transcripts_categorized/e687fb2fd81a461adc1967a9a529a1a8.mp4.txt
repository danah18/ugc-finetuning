}, I just had an everything shower and reminded me that I literally used to spend almost an hour in the shower trying to perfectly shave my bikini line. And then the day after, I'd look in the mirror and cry because of all the bumps, ingrowns, and irritations that I had from it. But one day, I had a heart-to-heart conversation with my sister and we realized we had the same struggles. But the problem was that there were no natural solutions on the market. So what we did was that we created our own solution. It's a five-step natural skincare routine that is going to replace your razor. If you have great skin, just ignore this. But in case you struggle, I did this routine for you. You can click the link if you want to check it out. Kisses, I'm in the garden now.
