}, All of my friends have been on about this newsletter and how it's helping their careers. I decided to check it out. It's called The Peak. My colleagues are getting a little jealous because my boss loves all my ideas, but he doesn't know that I get them from The Peak. I actually enjoy reading it. It's written in an engaging and entertaining way that makes me interested in reading about business, tech, and finance news. And it just takes five minutes to read. I literally read it while drinking my morning tea. They've got more than 125,000 readers, so head over to readthepeak.com. It's completely free.
