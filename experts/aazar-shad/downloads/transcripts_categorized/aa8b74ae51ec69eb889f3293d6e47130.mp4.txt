  "product_description": "A powdered supplement blend containing six medicinal mushrooms (Lion's Mane, cordyceps, reishi, turkey tail, shiitake, and king trumpet) designed to support brain function, memory, focus, energy, sleep, gut health, immunity, and reduce inflammation."
}, This is the number one food for your brain. I've been taking Lion's Mane in this secret morning concoction for the last few weeks, and let me tell you, the benefits are insane. So if you didn't know, Lion's Mane is like a super brain food that was used a lot in Eastern medicine to boost brain function and sharpen the mind. The anti-inflammatory properties help reduce inflammation in the brain and prevent neurodegenerative diseases when you get older. Plus, it's been proven to help improve mental sharpness, memory, focus, learning speed, and concentration. Lion's Mane is just one of the six incredible mushrooms inside every scoop of Rise. You've also got cordyceps for stamina and energy, reishi for calming sleep, turkey tail for gut health, and shiitake and king trumpet for immunity and anti-inflammatory support. It's hard to explain, but I just feel more present and alive, and I notice a big difference when I don't have my morning cup. Try it for yourself, and you'll see what I mean. They have a 30-day guarantee, so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
