}, Creating an ad just got so much easier. I'm going to use OpenAI to create a product and then an ad around it with copy and pictures and everything. Check this out. Alright, so first we need a product. So I'm going to do a candle. Let's go to Dali too. Typed in 3D render of a mid-century modern candle. Let's see that. Alright, so now go to ChatGPT. My lord. Dude, I told it nothing. It said, imagine coming home to a beautifully scented home after a long day of work. Light one of our candles and let the stress of the day melt away as you relax and unwind. Un-frickin-believable. This is so sick. I went to adcreative.ai. Got a login. Set up all my parameters like my logo, colors, and create brand. Stick around for part two guys.
