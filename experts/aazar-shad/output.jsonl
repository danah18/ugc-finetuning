Believe it or not, grounding your teen or those gentle parenting tips, there's a reason why they don't work for many. They're not addressing the root cause of your teen's behavior. You see, recent research shows that three main deficiencies could be the cause. Number one is folate deficiency. Teens often lack the crucial nutrients for oxygen, like folate. Less oxygen equals less brain function. Number two is vitamin B12 deficiency. B12 keeps the body's cells healthy. Without this, tiredness and irritability start to set in. And number three is vitamin D deficiency. The lack of vitamin D prevents proper calcium absorption, and some research indicates less calcium equals more stress. All of these deficiencies are actually a part of a worldwide problem that UNICEF calls hidden hunger. And so many studies and parents are discovering how nutrient deficiencies can be linked to behavior. So what can you do? You can try to force-feed your teen hundreds of cups of spinach to fit their folate needs, or broccoli to make up for these nutrient gaps. But let's get real, that's not happening. First Day has created a vitamin designed specifically to fight hidden hunger to fill in these nutrient gaps. It has the right amount of folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin D that could be missing even in good diets. These gummies are low in sugar and picky eater approved, so you can feel good about giving them to your teen. Plus, they taste delicious. Stop struggling with ineffective parenting techniques.

It's a colony of billions of mold and bacteria living deep inside your dishwasher that not only make your dishes cloudy and dirty, but can cause serious health issues if left untreated. The only solution was to disassemble your washer, soak it in bleach and hand clean every nook and cranny which can take hours. It wasn't until 2021 that scientists developed a solution. It was invented by a prominent but frustrated scientist. No matter how much his family washed their dishes, they kept noticing their dishes were coming out foggy or just plain dirty. One day he had a crazy idea. He put a waterproof camera in his dishwasher to see what was happening, and when he saw the footage, he was blown away. A greenish black substance was washing up from inside the washing machine and onto his dishes. It wasn't until he examined the dish under a microscope that he realized it was still covered in mold particles. Not just any mold. It was black mold that can be ingested into the bloodstream, causing headaches, memory loss, and fatigue, to name a few. He looked online for solutions, but each one was either ineffective or contained dangerous chemicals that could do more harm than good. So he took the problem back to his lab and developed a solution. He named it Fogo, a brilliant new formula that melts away all bacteria and mold and leaves behind an invisible seal, making it hard to grow back in the future. It's a patented formula that deep cleans your washing machine at a microscopic level. Just place one tablet in an empty dishwasher and run it on a normal cycle. Each tablet expands to create three gallons of all-natural antibacterial foam that deep cleans at a microscopic level. Each packet has six tablets that will last up to six months. It even works on your sink disposal. After seeing how well it worked, he started selling the product online. At first, he relied exclusively on word of mouth. What he didn't expect was for it to go viral on social media, with thousands of customers posting their before and after pictures using his product. Since launching last year, the founders have sold over 10 million Fuga dishwasher cleaner orders all over the world, with thousands of five-star reviews and a 92% repeat purchase rate. The regular price of Fuga dishwasher tablets is $60 for a pack of six tablets, but through this special promotion, you can get an exclusive 70% discount and order it for just $17.95 by clicking the link below. To distance themselves from cheap knockoffs, this product is not available on Amazon or any retailers. It's available exclusively through this online offer for a limited time.

Product description: \n  \"product_description\": \"A sturdy"}]}, "preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're struggling with lower back pain and sciatica, it's most likely due to a herniated disc or a compressed spine caused by years of hard work, prolonged sitting, bad posture, and damaging tension on your vertebrae. This causes your spinal discs to squeeze out of place, which puts pressure on your nerves, leading to that sharp pain in your lower back and down one or both of your legs. Millions of people suffer from this every day. Is it something that we can fix? Well, if we gave our overworked vertebrae a break to relax and decompress, they would stop putting pressure on inflamed nerves and discs and start healing. So, how do we make this happen? Painkillers and expensive chiropractor sessions do offer some relief, but unfortunately, it's only temporary and the pain comes back just as it was before. So, in search of a more effective, long-term fix, we decided to get in touch with a team of top chiropractors that worked on a solution to efficiently eliminate the root cause of pain and release all the damaging pressure in your spine. They revealed to us a completely new device that they built with the help of a company called Acemen, which helped thousands of their patients completely get rid of their back pain and sciatica. This is the Refresh Back Stretcher, a sturdy accessory that uses lumbar traction to comfortably stretch your spine at just the right angle while massaging and rehabilitating your back muscles using cleverly designed acupuncture ridges. It was built to support any body weight for any gender at any age. Simply lying down on it for just 10 minutes a day restores the natural curvature of your back, corrects your posture, and decompresses your spinal discs and nerves, giving them time to breathe and repair. The whole point of this device is to help your spine recover from years of damage and bad posture and get rid of all pain and inflammation for good. Another amazing thing is that it can also be used to alleviate pain in your neck, thus reducing tension headaches and migraines. 92% of the patients who tried the Refresh Stretcher felt relief from chronic sciatica, back pain, or neck pain after the first use and completely got rid of all discomfort in as little as 6 to 8 days. Here's what people experienced. Hi, my name's Steve and I've suffered for a long time with lower back pain, sometimes debilitating. I've tried painkillers, I've gone to the chiropractor, and I've even been advised that I might need surgery someday. Then my cousin recommended this to me, the Refresh Back Stretcher. And you know what? I thought, hey, I'll give it a shot. And the pain went significantly down after my first use. I went on to use this for a whole week every day. Didn't miss a day. The discomfort is completely gone. I'm so happy that I found this remedy. It's much cheaper than surgery, much healthier than taking pain pills. I suggest you check out this back stretcher before they're all gone. I've suffered from lower back pain for as long as I can remember. I've done everything. And then a friend of mine told me about the Refresh Back Stretcher. I go on this thing every single day and it has changed my back pain significantly. No more pain pills for me. You need to go out and get yourself one of these Refresh Back Stretchers. The great news is that Acemend has just restocked the widely successful neck and back stretcher. And because the results of the first run have been positively unprecedented, they've decided to offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. This means that if your pain isn't gone after using it, you have 30 days to get your money back. That's how confident Acemend is that their device will work the same for you as it did for thousands of other people. Don't let back pain control your life any longer. Try the Refresh Neck and Back Stretcher by clicking Shop Now below and take advantage of Acemend's 24-hour sale. Leaving the cause of back pain untreated could lead to prolonged nerve irritation, potentially resulting in more serious spinal injuries, poor sleep, muscle fatigue, and even loss of mobility.

Product description: \n  \"product_description\": \"The Neuro Knee Massager is a device designed to relieve knee pain by combining red light therapy"}]}, "preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "They laughed when I ordered this knee massager. Now they ask me where I got it. If you're struggling with knee pain, it means that your cartilage cushioning your knee joint is wearing down. This causes clicking, throbbing, instability, and pain. Simple everyday activities like driving, getting up and down stairs, getting up and out of a chair, and sleeping become incredibly uncomfortable. And the worst part is the feeling that life is passing you by, affecting you and your loved ones. However, the unavoidable problem with knee pain is that your knee's cartilage wears away as you age. This and lack of blood flow causes pain and inflammation. The tricky part? Your knees need movement to stimulate blood circulation, which aids in healing, reduces inflammation, and ultimately eliminates pain. But we all know that when we have knee pain, the last thing you want to do is move and put strain on your hurting knee. Luckily, one of the most successful orthopedists specializing in treating arthritis teamed up with Neuro, a US-based startup. Together with Neuro, he designed a breakthrough knee massager that solves this problem. The secret to the FDA-cleared Neuro knee massager is a unique combination of the three most effective treatments for arthritis. One, red light therapy. Two, heat therapy. Three, massage therapy. Red light therapy helps collagen production. Collagen makes up 85% of your knee's cartilage. Increasing collagen production helps to reverse the damage to cartilage in your knees. Heat therapy loosens the muscles around and inside the knee. It stimulates blood flow. This allows more blood, oxygen, and nutrients to be delivered to the injured tissue. Better blood circulation results in recovery and healing. Massage therapy relaxes tight muscles and tissue. Your knee pain is replaced with a feeling of bliss and relief. So you can get back to squatting, jogging, getting up and down stairs, and driving, completely free of knee pain. Not to mention the real benefits of getting back to living your best life, happy and fulfilled. The best part? It's so simple to use. You just slide it onto your painful knee, push the on button, and enjoy one of the many available programs. Over the course of the year, our customers save on average of $3,428 in physical therapist appointments, painkillers, and other knee pain treatments. Hear from Steven, who is just days away from a knee surgery when he found out about the Neuro Knee Massager. My wife saw an ad for the Neuro Knee Massager, and she wanted to avoid my knee surgery at all costs. So after doing a little bit of research and seeing all the positive reviews, we decided to give it a try. Take it from me, this thing literally saved my life. After using it for just one week, I canceled my surgery and continue using it to this day. The Neuro Knee Massager turned the clock back on my knees. It literally gave me my life back. Now I can enjoy the things I used to love, like long walks and cycling and jogging with my wife. Thank you, Neuro. Here's Karen, 54, who loves to do yoga and enjoys family activities whenever she can. Honestly, I was at rock bottom. My knees had gotten so painful that I had to stop doing all the things I love to do. I couldn't even stretch. I had problems getting into my car. I mean, I know I'm not 20 anymore, but I'm also not 80 either. I used painkillers. I mean, they're great for short-term relief, but they're addictive and they have a lot of negative side effects. I tried going to physical therapy too, and that's great as well, but they're so expensive. And I had to drive like an hour just to get to every appointment. I mean, I was desperate. I really needed help. And that's when I saw a Facebook ad for the Neuro Massager. It promised a lot, and all the reviews seemed to confirm that it was indeed a great product. So, on the website, they had a 90-day results or refund guarantee. So, I decided, well, what have I got to lose? So, I gave it a chance. And after I called Catherine from their customer service to confirm that this refund guarantee was real, I pulled the trigger and ordered two massagers for my knees. Well, let me just say, these things are miracle workers. It's been two weeks, and my knee massage is now my favorite part of the entire day. My knee pain is gone, and I'm looking forward to the family hike that we've got planned for this weekend. You know, anyone out there who's got knee pain, you know, if I can do this, you can do it too. So, go ahead and get your life back. You heard it. Neuro offers a 90-day results or refund guarantee. No questions asked. That means if you don't get relief from knee pain or you simply don't like the product, you get a full refund, and you don't even need to return the product. Last time I checked, they were sold out because of a special $200 discount. So, if they're still available, I recommend getting yours before they sell out again.

And for people with more sensitive skins we have the Schaktimat light which you can use on more tender parts of your body like the chest or the belly.\nYou can also begin by using the mat on a sofa or a bed or wearing a thin t-shirt to allow time for the body to adjust to using the Schaktimat on bare skin.

I'm actually not. I'm crazy optimized. But one of the most unique things about how I work is I don't have a to-do list. Absolutely zero. There is no set of to-do items I even think about. And it turns out that science actually says this is a far more effective way to operate your life if you're playing at a big level. You do not need a to-do list. Rather, what you need is an optimized calendar. Now, I'm sharing this with you because this week on Mindvalley, we're going to be talking about the concept of focus, the concept of indistractibility. That word is coined by the famous author Nir Eyal. Nir is one of the leading minds on the topics of focus, on becoming indistractable, on getting things done effectively. And I want to invite you to join me on a masterclass where we're going to go deep with Nir on why you should take your to-do list and completely tear it apart. And instead, you should have a Google calendar that looks as beautifully complex as mine. These ideas in this masterclass will probably save you two to three hours a week.

Product description: \n  \"product_description\": \"A free"}]}, "preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "This box is actually 27 years old. And I want to tell you what's in this box. I learned a technique from a spiritual teacher where every time I have a crazy dream or a goal, I write it in a piece of paper and I put it in this box. And I imagine as if this box is kind of like a genie or a magic machine and these goals come true. So in this box, you'll find some crazy stuff. Don't ask me what this is. It's a unicorn buck. A Christmas card with Star Wars characters singing. A broken arrow from a Harbecker class where I had to break an arrow with my neck. But this piece of paper, this piece of paper started it all. And this is what we're going to talk about today. This paper says June 2008, Mindvalley 300K in sales. Okay, let me tell you what was going on there. In May of 2008, I had been an entrepreneur for five years and I realized that I was in a horrible situation. We had 18 people working for Mindvalley back then, but we were making about a quarter million a month in revenue. But we were losing money every single month. And we knew if this, this loss didn't stop, we were about to run out of cash in the bank. And we would have to let go of a good chunk of our team. I tried everything, business consultants, marketing strategies, hiring MBAs. Nothing was changing that. I went into one of those zones where I just couldn't focus and work because the fear, the anxiety was so great. Now back then, my life was really different. I drove a tiny Nissan March. I did not have enough money. Everything was going to this company that was not really going anywhere for the first five years. And I lived in a room still in my parents' house. You see, I had failed to realize that ultimately everything we see in life is about what's going on in here. And I was trying all the physical outside tools, but not paying attention to the stuff that's right here in between our ears. I flew to San Diego to attend a class by a spiritual teacher. I signed up for a four-day seminar by another personal growth master. I went deep into the works of philosophers like Neil Donald Walsh and Esther Hicks. This piece of paper where I'd written down my goal, 300K, we'd been stuck at 250K for a year. And all of a sudden, an idea clicked and we hit 300K. So I thought, well, why not go a little further? I took my team to the beach to celebrate. And there we held up a sign in the sand with the word 500K. In three months, we hit 500K. Emboldened by ability to just grow all of a sudden so rapidly, we set a new goal for one million. And in a mere eight months from May 2008 when I put this in the box, we hit a million. The company had grown 400%. But it wasn't a specific growth strategy. It wasn't some grand new innovation. It was because what was going on in my head had changed. And if you want to know the exact things that I learned that caused me to pull Mindvalley out of this situation of near death, moving from a tiny crammed residential house to an office that just made Inc. Magazine Top 10 Most Beautiful Offices, I want to invite you to join me on a one-hour deep dive into these ideas. You don't just have to be a CEO or a founder. This class is for anyone who wants to get out of a slump, who feels you're kind of hitting a ceiling and you've tried everything else. And I want to show you how to break through this feeling by expanding your levels of consciousness to go to new heights so that you transform the world based on what you're feeling inside here.

I'm a huge fan of BlendJet. I use it multiple times per day for my coffee, for my pre-workout, for my daughter's smoothies. One of my favorite parts of the day is just turning it on. So whether you're doing keto, paleo, vegan, vegetarian, it doesn't really matter. BlendJet fits into all those categories and makes all of those lifestyles way more convenient. So one of the things that impressed me with the BlendJet was how powerful it is. I could throw in ice, I could throw in frozen berries, and this thing did the job on all of them. Probably one of the best features that I love about the BlendJet is how easy it is to clean. It's the convenience of it. All the parents out there or people that are pressed for time will love this feature the most. So one of the cool things about the BlendJet is the USB charger, and you can bring this thing with you anywhere you go, and you can get up to 15 blends in one charge. I love that BlendJet has all these amazing colors and patterns and different styles so each person can find one that fits them and their style. So one of the biggest takeaways from my Fit2Pet Fit experience that I've done, I can honestly say I have developed so much more empathy for those that struggle.

I knew I wanted to lose weight and I wasn't sure what I needed to do to lose the weight. I was really unhappy and in my after picture, it showed really how happy I was after losing all the weight. It made a big change in my life by just replacing my school lunches with smoothies in my BlendJet. I would put the kids down for a nap, put some protein powder and some fruit in my BlendJet, and I'm so blind that I can blend it up during that time. One of the hardest things with my old blender was cleaning it, and with BlendJet, they say it cleans itself and it really does. All you need to do is put in some water, put a drop of soap in, turn it on, and it cleans itself. I charge my BlendJet with a USB charger. It's very convenient. It only takes an hour, and I get about 15 blends per charge. Because our BlendJets are so beautiful and our family has them in all different colors, we leave them out on the counter, and it's a reminder to have a nice smoothie every day. Don't let the small size of a BlendJet fool you. This thing has a lot of power. I'm a schoolteacher. I'm not an actor. In fact, I'm taking time after work in my classroom to do this for you. If it's something that you're thinking about and you're listening to this and you're contemplating, how can I do it? How can I lose the weight? Give BlendJet a try.
