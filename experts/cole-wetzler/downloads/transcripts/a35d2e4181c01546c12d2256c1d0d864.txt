I literally bought these fragrances for less than $100 for ALT's Black Friday sale. I discovered ALT Fragrances last year and I will never buy designer fragrances ever again. They are fragrances inspired by the designer version, but get this, a fraction of the price. I honestly wouldn't have even left the house without my designer perfumes on. It was honestly my classic scent, so the fact that my friends couldn't even tell the difference definitely tells a lot about how good these fragrances are. And get this, I can afford four of ALTs for the same price as one of the designer versions. It's seriously a win-win situation. Go check out altfragrances.com, you'll thank me later.
