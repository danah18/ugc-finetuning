Are these the best golf clubs for beginner and casual golfers? That's what the company Robin says. What Robin wanted to do was to simplify the process to get more people into the game, provide quality clubs that are geared towards beginner and high-handicap golfers with performance in mind and with aesthetics in mind and keeping that price low. This is for you. And this is going to come with your standard beginner nine clubs. You've got your sand, your pitch, your five, seven, nine. Even the grips are pretty good. It does feel solidly built.
