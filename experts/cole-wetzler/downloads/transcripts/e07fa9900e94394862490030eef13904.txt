Look, I have a very traditional work uniform. I get it. I look good in red. And these soft furs? Very expensive. But there is one brand I trust to keep me looking classic and feeling comfortable at a great price. True Classic. It accentuates my chest and arms and feels as soft as my furs. And I'll be honest, I don't always like being described as jolly. Sometimes I prefer sexy beast. Or El Capitan. Mrs. Claus likes that.
