Is this offer too good to be true? Guys, it is actually so difficult to find scents online that smell good and are just kind of like not until now. All fragrances is running a crazy deal where the entire site is 20% off and if you spend $100, 25% off. I ordered Desert Phantom and I absolutely love it. Not only does it smell amazing, but the package is so aesthetically pleasing. I literally love how it looks on my bedside table. Also, the fact that it's sustainably made, as well as manufactured and shipped in the US, really makes it a no-brainer. I've been wearing this one for the past week and let me tell you the compliments I've been receiving. It's insane. I have gotten compliments from my coworkers, friends, family, strangers.
