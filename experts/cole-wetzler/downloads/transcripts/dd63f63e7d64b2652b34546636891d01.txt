This Black Friday weekend, All is offering 25% off their website. Run, don't walk. All offers fragrances that smell exactly like the designer version, but don't leave quite as big of a dent in your pocket. I used to wear the designer version of this and it cost $260. Now I spend $40 on the exact same smell and no one could tell the difference. It's a win-win. Even my girlfriend can't tell the difference and I've been wearing the designer version the whole time she's known me. If you want to smell like a million bucks for an affordable price, check out allfragrances.com now.
