I just got my order from licorice.com and I'm gonna taste a few of these for you. We're gonna start off with Australian Red. Let's see how it tastes. Chewy but not sticky. Wow. Really, really rich flavor. I like literally I'm smelling it out of my mouth and my nose. It's awesome. I'm about to taste Sweet and Sour Petites. That's what they look like. Those are actually really good. If you like red licorice, you should get this. This is a winner!
