Wow! Whoa! It does feel like I'm hugged. Ooh, this is so nice! I feel super tired. I'm just gonna lay down. Nice feeling goes to my eyes. It feels like a lot of blankets on top of me, but I can breathe. Like I'm laying in one of those little weightless pools. High quality. It feels like I'm being hugged all angled, but not strangled. It's a lovely hug. Ah, I don't wanna wake up. The perfect gift. I love it.
