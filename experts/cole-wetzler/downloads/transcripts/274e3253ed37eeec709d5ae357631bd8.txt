What's up guys, Alex here. Just finished a shoot with Built today. The Everyday Pant 2.0. Incredible, fell in love with them, they're awesome. Slim fit, slightly tapered at the ankle, they're stretched, so comfortable. Can't tell you enough, besides having the best shirts out there, now they have some incredible pants. Go check them out today, BuiltBasics.com.
