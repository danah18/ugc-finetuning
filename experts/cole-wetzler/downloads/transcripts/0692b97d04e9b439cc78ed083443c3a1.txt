It's finally time to change my wallet, and Ekster helped me out with that. And this is their aluminum card holder, and mine's the green or colorway. And it can hold up to 15 cards, six in the card holder and the rest in the back. And they were nice enough to include their tracker card, which will help me never lose my wallet or my phone. But I'm totally excited to use this as my daily carry.
