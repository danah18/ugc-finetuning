Are you tired of getting little razor bumps after you shave? Then you have to switch to Supply's new single edge razor. Watch this. Glides across your skin. So the whole premise of multi-blade razors is that they lift and cut hair beneath the surface of the skin. This can be bad for a lot of guys because it can lead to ingrown hairs. A single blade cuts at the surface of the skin without the added risk of razor bumps. You don't even have to put much pressure. I've got three settings so that I can trim it nicely however I like. It comes with a neat replacement mesh, nice smooth finish, and honestly the best part is it really has delineated all of those actions and burns. It's a game changer. Get you one. Guarantee it. You will not be disappointed.
