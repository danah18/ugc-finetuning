  "product_description": "A portable powdered electrolyte drink mix designed for adults, especially those who drink alcohol. It has higher electrolyte content, added ginger for nausea, L-theanine for anxiety, additional vitamins for fatigue, and is easy to pack for people on the go. It is positioned as an improved alternative to Liquid IV, Pedialyte, and Gatorade."
}, Easiest way is to just show it to you in this video. One sec. So as you can see, Liquid IV has almost one gram of electrolytes and 11 grams of sugar. Pedialyte has almost four times the amount. So then we thought, let's take all the electrolytes out of Pedialyte and put them in a powder stick. But because we made ours for adults that drink and not kids, we added ginger for nausea, L-thane for anxiety, and we made it portable and easy to pack for those on the go, and some more vitamins for fatigue. So this chart is really the main difference. Gatorade doesn't even really come close to compare.
