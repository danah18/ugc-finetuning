}, Active people, particularly in hot or humid environments, need a lot more sodium. The American College of Sports Medicine recommend that folks get as much as 7 to 10 grams of sodium per day. The problem is that people are told to get anywhere from 2 to 3 grams of sodium, which is woefully deficient. This is why we formulated Element with a full gram of sodium per serving, to help people feel their best, avoid cramps and headaches, and avoid dehydration.
