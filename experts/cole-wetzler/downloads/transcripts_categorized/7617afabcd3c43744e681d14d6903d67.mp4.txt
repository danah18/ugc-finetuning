], Black Friday and Cyber Monday are upon us and this is where I will be shopping. First up, you probably could have guessed Essence. They have an unbelievable Cyber Monday. It's going to take a lot of digging, a lot of going through pages, but you will find such a good deal. Next up is N'Dom. They have really cute cashmere. I just got this set and they're doing 40% off already. They have such good quality cashmere. I got someone a gift from here as well. They have a store in West Village, so I've touched the cashmere before and it's unbelievable quality. 10 out of 10 recommend. This is a great gift. Alpha H is one of my favorite skincare lines and they're doing a Black Friday sale. I'm obsessed with their liquid gold treatment. They're doing this little duo that you can get on sale. And I swear to God, the liquid gold is what makes my skin glow. So get your hands on it while it's on sale. The last line LA, the jewelry line, hasn't announced that they're doing a sale, but I'm sure that they will. And I'm dying to get these little cherry earrings. They're so me. I have no doubt they'll do at least 15% off and they never go on sale. Obviously, you need to hop on the Net-A-Porter sale. I doubt it's going to be as good as Essence, but I'm going to look. Happy shopping!
