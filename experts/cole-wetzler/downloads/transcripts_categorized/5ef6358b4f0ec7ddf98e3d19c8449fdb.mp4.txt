}, Ever come back from your dog walk with your socks absolutely soaked from morning dew? This was me every day until I discovered Vessi. Vessi is a Canadian brand that designed the first fully waterproof knit sneaker. I'd never seen a knit waterproof shoe that wasn't made with coating or spray until I discovered these. But when I tell you, as a dog parent, these have been absolutely game-changing. I can now go to my fur child's favorite places without having to worry about where I'm stepping. Plus, they're super easy to slip on in the morning, and they look great too. Toss on a hoodie, slip on your Vessis, and head out the door. Perfect for those 6am walks when you're half asleep and you don't even jink up your PJs. I don't have to look like I just rolled out of bed anymore. Go get yours before this video makes it to every dog parent out there and sells out.
