I love my new bedding from Sunday Citizen. It's so, so soft. It has a really nice weight to it. And one of the big things that sold me on Sunday Citizen is that it is pet-friendly. Wear and tear, nails, wash. You can just not have to stress about the hassle that it is to undo all bedding when something happens to it because of a pet. This is amazing. The soft bamboo on one side and then this beautiful, resilient but luxurious chenille on the other. We can enjoy our bedding and it also looks really good in our new bedroom. Thank you, Sunday Citizen.
