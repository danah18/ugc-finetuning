Let me put you on my best kept secret for getting rid of dark circles and puffy eyes. The Grace and Stella Energy Drink Eye Mask and the If Eyes Could Smile Eye Cream. Not only do they feel amazing to put on, but I visibly notice my skin looking better. And that's all thanks to the powerful ingredients. Instead of wasting your hard-earned money on dozens of different eye treatments, all you need are these. One pair in the morning to reduce the puffiness. A small bit of eye cream in the morning and before bed. A little bit of eye cream has caffeine, niacinamide, zinc oxide, just to name a few. After a few weeks of following the routine, my eyes were brighter and less puffy. Trust me, once you try it, you won't look back.
