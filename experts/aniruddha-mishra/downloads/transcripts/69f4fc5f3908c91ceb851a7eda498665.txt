Seriously have never loved a pan so much. I could literally talk about this pan forever. The Always Pan was actually designed to replace up to eight pieces of cookware and I can tell you it definitely has for me. I boil, steam, deep fry, everything in this pan. I love this. I always steam my veggies in this. The coating is also non-toxic and non-stick. I cannot tell you how many non-stick pans prior to this one I have been through. Favorite, favorite, favorite thing about this pan is it literally just wipes out. Anyone, I promise, will be so excited to get this pan.
