A single blade cuts at the surface of the skin without the added risk of razor bumps.\n\nYou don't even have to put much pressure. It's got three settings so that I can trim it nicely however I like. It comes with a complete replacement head. Nice smooth finish. And honestly, the best part is it really has eliminated all of those cuts and burns. It's a game changer. Get you one. Guarantee it.
