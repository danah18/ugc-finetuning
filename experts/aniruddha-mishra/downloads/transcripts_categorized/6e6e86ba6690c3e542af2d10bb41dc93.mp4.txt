}, Your portable charger will not fit in your wallet. This is a clutch charger. See the difference? See, there is no way that this charger is going to fit in my purse. The clutch just slides in like a credit card. It's so cute and tiny. The thing I love most about it is there are no long, annoying cords. The cord is built in. Plug it into your phone or tablet and you're charging wherever you are. Now I literally don't go anywhere without this baby. This is my new favorite thing.
