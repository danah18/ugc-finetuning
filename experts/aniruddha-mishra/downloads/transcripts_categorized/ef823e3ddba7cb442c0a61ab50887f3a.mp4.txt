}, This is our Focus Blend that's blowing up on TikTok right now. It is a blend of lion's mane, cordyceps, rhodiola, and other functional mushrooms and adaptogens that are incredible at supporting cognition, focus, and productivity. Our favorite way to use this is by putting a scoop in before your coffee, mixing it up, and drinking like you would your normal coffee. This is perfect for days where you need a little extra focus.
