I was thinking about going back to therapy, but I was worried that it was going to be too much of a hassle. I'm a mom, so trying to find time to look out for myself? A friend of mine kept telling me I had to check out Cerebral, and it completely changed everything I thought I knew about therapy. After taking a quick online questionnaire, Cerebral matched me with a therapist and a treatment plan personalized to me. They're able to meet on my schedule, no matter how hectic, and I can manage and attend all of my sessions from the comfort of my home, so I can easily take a moment for myself and still be there for my family. They even helped me find a new therapist when I didn't feel right with the first one. If you're exploring your treatment options, I highly recommend Cerebral.
