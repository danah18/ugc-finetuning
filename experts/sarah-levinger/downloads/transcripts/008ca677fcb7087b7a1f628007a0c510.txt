Friend get-together ideas part five. Trust me, we've done it all. Board games, card games, we needed something a little different. We wanted something that could create even more memories. So I bought us a Stoke Stove. It's a gas pizza oven that cooks pizza, get this, within two minutes. It has created such amazing memories with friends and family. We laugh a lot and it's really fun to create so many different types of pizzas within our Stoke Stove. It'd really be great for any in-home date night, sporting event, family gatherings, and more. It's easy to travel with, easy to set up, and you just have to go check them out at stokestove.com. You'll be obsessed just like we are.
