This is how I eat healthy during the holidays. I'm trying to stay healthy this holiday season, but there are sweets everywhere. My friend told me about Magic Spoon cereal bars made from that viral cereal on TikTok. It tastes like sweets without the carbs, grain, gluten, you know, guilt. Just high protein, actually delicious, 100% happiness guaranteed. Try the dessert flavors from cookies and cream to cocoa peanut butter.
