I'm never going back to regular cereal again. I've tried some healthier cereals with less sugar, but they honestly tasted like cardboard. I saw a ton of people on TikTok talking about Magic Spoon, and oh my gosh, this cereal brought me back to my childhood. We're talking frosted, peanut butter, fruity, that's my favorite, and cocoa, and so much more. And here's the magic part. It's loaded with protein and has only four grams of net carbs, zero grams of sugar. Zero grams. Did I mention it's keto-friendly? Keto-friendly. So not only do I get to eat like a kid again for breakfast, but I'm actually being healthy? Yeah, I'd call that a game changer.
