Cerebral, online mental health therapy and counseling platform, Going to a therapist's office for the first time can be really stressful and intimidating, and the point of therapy should be the opposite. It should be a calm, supportive experience. One of the best parts of Cerebral is you get to do it from your own home. You don't have to feel that stress, it's a lot easier to open up about more personal issues. Even without health insurance, I can still afford Cerebral. It's super easy and convenient, just go to their website, take a quiz. I feel so much better with Cerebral.
