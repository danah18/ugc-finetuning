This is my favorite morning smoothie recipe. My go-to is a peanut butter and berry smoothie, so that's what we're doing today in my BlendJet. I can't get over how easy it is to do. First, we start with our liquid base, then we add in our frozen fruit, then we add in my mom's amazing homemade yogurt, then we add a scoop of protein powder and drizzle of honey, and lastly, we top with chia seeds. I would totally recommend grabbing this for yourself, so shop your own at blendjet.com.
