So I hate ordering clothes online because fit is so important. Small, medium, large, that just doesn't work. Until I found this website. It takes you 30 seconds to fill this thing out. Now we create our size, body shape, and there it is. Excellent quality. This is very well made. They cut the material literally for you. There's hardly any waste. First time we're trying this guy on. Wow, look at that. The length is spot on. It's not too tight. It's not too loose. This is a good T-shirt. Actually, this is a great T-shirt. Go check out Son of a Tailor.
