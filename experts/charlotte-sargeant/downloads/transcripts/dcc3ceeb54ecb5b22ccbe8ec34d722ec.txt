Three reasons why I'm obsessed with the Essence Vault fragrances. Number one, inspired by designer brands but at a fraction of the cost. Number two, comes in three different sizes. Number three, long lasting scents. I can't stop buying the Essence Vault. There's so many products to choose from, like perfumes for me, cologne for my boyfriend, and diffusers for my home. Smells like the original but way more affordable. Made with premium quality ingredients that last all day long. Trust me on this and check out the Essence Vault.
