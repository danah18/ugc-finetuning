Have you tried everything to fix insomnia, but nothing worked? Watch this. I'm 60 years old and I haven't had a good night's sleep in years. Most nights I would toss and turn, struggling to fall asleep. I would also wake up randomly in the middle of the night feeling anxious for no reason. I've tried sleeping pills, melatonin, CBD, but nothing worked. Turns out I was magnesium deficient. Then my son got me this sleepy lotion from 8 Sheep Organics. It contains deep sea magnesium, an extremely pure natural form of magnesium which our bodies can absorb well. It's really effective at promoting deep, restful sleep. Since then, I've been sleeping through the night and waking up feeling so refreshed. If you're struggling with insomnia like I was, I highly recommend this lotion.
