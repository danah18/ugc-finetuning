Three reasons why I'm obsessed with my new glass prints from Fracture. Number one, these are so high quality and beautiful and unique. They're so different than a normal frame. Anyone can just print out a picture and put it in a frame, but to have your picture on glass is just so unique. It's one of a kind. Second, it's so easy to order and set up. I am not a handy person. I'm not a tech savvy person, and it took me maybe a minute to order it and then to actually install it was super, super easy as well. And three, it's such a beautiful way to showcase your loved ones. I'm getting married soon, and so seeing these pictures of our engagement just brings up such great memories and makes me so excited for the wedding, and we get so many compliments every time we have visitors. So get some for yourself and head to fractureme.com.
