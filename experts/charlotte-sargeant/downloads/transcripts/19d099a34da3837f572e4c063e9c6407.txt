Ordering your custom fit garment is simple. First off, choose your preferred product and color. Next up is creating your unique size. Simply enter your height, weight, age, and shoe size, along with your body type. Based on the data you provided, our perfect fit algorithm generates a unique size, custom fitted exclusively for you. Afterwards, proceed to checkout. Once we've received your order, our production team in Portugal begins making your garment, and once it's done and quality checked, we ship it directly to your home. And the best part is, you can easily use your size to reorder directly from the Son of a Tailor website.
