POV: you found a website with cute AND affordable frames. Introducing Zenni. I used to pay way too much for eyewear until I started shopping with Zenni. These are quality glasses that literally cost a fraction of my old frames and will last me longer too. There are tons of fashion-forward styles to choose from on here, but don't worry, they have this super cool virtual try-on feature that allows you to test different frames before you order them. I literally tried on a ton before going with these three. It's also such a perk that these are blue light, so I can work all day on my laptop or phone without straining my eyes.
