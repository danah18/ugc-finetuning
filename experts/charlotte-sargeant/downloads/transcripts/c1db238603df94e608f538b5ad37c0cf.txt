My hair looks so bad. My nails keep breaking. I can't lose any weight. I've been taking Skinny Fit Super Youth every day for a month and let me tell you, this is the real deal. This collagen powder has five different types of collagen, apple cider vinegar, and hyaluronic acid. It tastes amazing, it dissolves so easily, and it isn't at all sticky and clumpy like other brands. My skin is glowing, my hair and nails look so healthy. I'm less bloated, I've lost some weight, and my clothes fit me better. I wish I tried this sooner. Get yours now.
