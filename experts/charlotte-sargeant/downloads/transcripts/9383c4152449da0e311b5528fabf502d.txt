We haven't had medical insurance for several years. I found Sesame online, found a doctor through Sesame, and I have used them several times. My visits have been great. I haven't had a bad experience yet. It feels more personable dealing directly with the doctor instead of through the insurance. To me, that's just cutting through all the nonsense of an insurance company.
