What I ordered versus what I got. I somehow convinced my mom to order me the most luxurious dog bed. All of my friends at the park were telling me it's the best one, so I had to see what the hype was about. This is the best thing I've ever stepped paw on, and boy is it worth it, according to my mom, at least. She even sat down on it with me and said this orthopedic foam is good for my joints and bones. I don't know what that means, but it sounds good. Anyway, I would 14 out of 10 recommend this bed, so tell your owners to go on the internet and find it at bigbarker.com.
