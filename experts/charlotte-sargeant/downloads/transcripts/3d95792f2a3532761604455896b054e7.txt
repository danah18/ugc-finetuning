Fragrance finds too good not to share. I am someone who loves a luxury perfume, but not the crazy price tag. I kept hearing everyone talk about the Essence Vault online, so I thought I'd try it out. They make fragrances that are inspired by designer brands by using similar notes to signature perfumes, but at a fraction of the cost. It's seriously the best of both worlds. I get premium quality fragrance that I love without breaking the bank. I can get them in three different sizes and even as a home diffuser. The most affordable way to smell luxurious all day long. I'm obsessed with the Essence Vault and you will be too when you shop the essencevault.co.uk.
