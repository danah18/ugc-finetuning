Like most guys, I just used whatever soap or shower gel I could find in the nearest grocery aisle. But I didn't realize that most commercial soaps are formulated with cheap synthetic ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens, and phthalates. Plus, they smell cheap and light chemicals. So I started doing research on alternatives to synthetic soap. And that's when I discovered the natural oil-based soaps made in the traditional cold process. This stuff was game-changing. The mission was simple. I wanted to create a brand that made high-quality natural soaps accessible to all guys. You'd be surprised how excited people can get about soap. It's really made a difference for so many people. The scents are also super unique. Customers love our real natural scents like bay rum, birchwood breeze, and fresh falls. A lot of men really love the scratchiness of our exfoliating bars like pine tar here and wood barrel bourbon. Here we got the cold brew cleanse. One of my personal favorites, you can see the little coffee grains in there. As I look to the future of Dr. Squatch's impact, an area that I'm personally excited about is our give-back programs. We've worked with nonprofits to donate hundreds of thousands of bars and soap to people in need around the globe. I really hope Dr. Squatch can be a force for change in improving the health of people no matter where they are. Building Dr. Squatch has been one of the greatest journeys of my life.

RocketFire was designed to light a grill or fire pit or anything that's flammable as fast as possible. So in the beginning, a good friend of mine and I were sitting around talking about how to light the grill. It currently took forever to light our Kamado-style grill. There were good ways, but not a great way. And so I designed, over the last five years, a great way to start a fire. The design of the RocketFire is set up for a grill or fire pit. So it has a wand, it's a 17-inch wand. You can put it over top of the wood, over top of the charcoal, or you can put it directly into the wood or charcoal. It gives you an even distribution of flame, which means you light faster. It's very easy to get the fuel. You can use propane, you can use map gas. It's cost effective, so you can get 50 to 70 lights off of one canister. You can take off the tip and finish off sous vide meat. You can also use it to finish off creme brulee. It's made of stainless steel, it's made of brass, it's made of carbon fiber. I mean, it is... I wanted a quality product. I wanted something that I'd be proud of and the people that owned it would be proud of.

Both of my girls have struggled with severe allergies until I started giving them these allergy and itch chews by Finn. So here's what you can expect. Within the first week, they will love these and look at them more like treats. By the second week, you will see reduction in itching and paw licking. And by the third week, you will see an overall reduction in their allergy symptoms as a whole. These Finn allergy chews are made with real ingredients and no fillers to give both Maple and Willow real relief.
