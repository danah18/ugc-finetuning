Solis Bands, replacement Apple Watch bands in various colors and designs that are comfortable, stretchy, and easy to wear., Here's a UGC video example I did for a brand. This was a TikTok ad and it resulted in a top 3% conversions in a similar niche. I gave my Apple Watch another chance because of these bands. I got my Apple Watch so I could track my sleep, go to the gym, but the band was giving me a major rash every time. I found Solis bands and their cute colors and designs just totally sold me in seconds. So naturally I ordered three different colors to match my fall outfits. Love how stretchy they are and it's so easy to slide it on and off my wrist. Finally able to wear my Apple Watch all day and all night and actually track my sleep. I 100% recommend them.
