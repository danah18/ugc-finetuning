Finn, allergy and itch chews for dogs that help reduce allergy symptoms and itching, Here's my review of the dog allergy vitamin that TikTok is raving about. Both of my girls have struggled with severe allergies until I started giving them these allergy and itch chews by Finn. So here's what you can expect. Within the first week, they will love these and look at them more like treats. By the second week, you will see reduction in itching and paw licking. And by the third week, you will see an overall reduction in their allergy symptoms as a whole. These Finn allergy chews are made with real ingredients and no fillers to give both Maple and Willow real relief. So I highly recommend checking out petfinn.com.
