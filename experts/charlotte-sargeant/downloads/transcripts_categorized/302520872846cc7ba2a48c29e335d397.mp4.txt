Dr. Squatch, natural oil-based soap for men with unique scents and exfoliating options, formulated without synthetic chemicals, Why men won't believe this soap founder story.
My name is Jack Haldrop and I'm the founder and CEO of Dr. Squatch. Like most guys, I just used whatever soap or shower gel I could find in the nearest grocery aisle. But I didn't realize that most commercial soaps are formulated with cheap synthetic ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens, and phthalates. Plus, they smell cheap and light chemicals. So I started doing research on alternatives to synthetic soap. And that's when I discovered the natural oil-based soaps made in the traditional cold process. This stuff was game-changing. The mission was simple. I wanted to create a brand that made high-quality natural soaps accessible to all guys. You'd be surprised how excited people can get about soap. It's really made a difference for so many people. The scents are also super unique. Customers love our real natural scents like bay rum, birchwood breeze, and fresh falls. A lot of men really love the scratchiness of our exfoliating bars like pine tar here and wood barrel bourbon. Here we got the cold brew cleanse. One of my personal favorites, you can see the little coffee grains in there. As I look to the future of Dr. Squatch's impact, an area that I'm personally excited about is our give-back programs. We've worked with nonprofits to donate hundreds of thousands of bars and soap to people in need around the globe. I really hope Dr. Squatch can be a force for change in improving the health of people no matter where they are. Building Dr. Squatch has been one of the greatest journeys of my life.
