[Unknown, A high-end skincare serum or facial treatment that significantly improves skin quality and serves as an alternative to Botox.], Okay, this is so nice. This is what I do, okay? I'm just gonna be straight up and say I've never spent this much on any type of product ever. I've never even spent this much on like getting my hair done really, honestly. So this is $290, but it has changed the game. Like my skin, this is my fourth bottle. I'm obsessed with it. It actually lasts me a really long time and my skin just drinks this. Tyler always laughs at me because that's the term I use. I'm like, my skin drinks this. It's the best stuff I've ever owned. It's so worth the money. It's a ridiculous price. I never thought I'd spend that. I haven't had Botox in two years because of it. Like I'm obsessed. And then I also just add like a drop of this to the like, I do one pump in my hand and I add one drop and I just mix it together with my finger and put it on my face.
