Post-vacation detox hack. Post-vacation slump is real, that's why I decided to try Factor. They offer pre-cooked meals, breakfast smoothies, juices, and snacks. These two-minute meals are prepped by professional chefs. They help with portion control, calorie tracking, eating clean. These meals are delicious and make clean eating so much easier. Total game-changer. 100 out of 10 would recommend.
