I've tried so many other generic brands that literally have damaged my hair, dried my hair out, or ruined my entire hair texture. I want defined curls that look healthy. I had to try Proz. I got shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, and it even has my name on it. The hair feels so clean. Look how cute and bouncy this curl is. Okay, so this is the curl cream, and this is going to give me the curls I'm looking for and help me style my hair. My curls are already looking bouncy. Wow. My hair is finally dry. Look at these curls. I've never seen my hair look this good out of the shower. Proz really did wonders on my hair.
