I'll let you see what your scalp looks like after working out every day and not washing it for five days. Day one of not washing my hair as a fitness instructor. Day two, dirty hair, and I just taught a 45-minute workout class. Wish me luck. It's been three days since I washed my hair, and it is happening. Day four, dirty hair. What is happening?
