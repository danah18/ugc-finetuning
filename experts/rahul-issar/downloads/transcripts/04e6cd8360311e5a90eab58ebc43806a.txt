Three reasons why I regret buying these toothpaste bits from Bite. Number one, it makes me so frustrated at how long I was using wasteful toothpaste tubes since these are way better for the environment as they come in refillable glass jars. Number two, my teeth have never looked so nice and shiny. I'm upset I didn't find this sooner. And number three, my friends noticed a difference in my smile and keep asking me about Bite. I love using these every day, not only because I know I'm making a smarter and more sustainable choice, but there's so many benefits for my teeth like strengthening, anti-cavity, and naturally whitening. I know I'm making a difference in my smile and the planets in switching to Bite. So if you're ready to be addicted, check out these toothpaste bits at trybite.com.
