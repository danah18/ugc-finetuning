I have a lot of hair, but it can look really thin and flat. My hair struggles with retaining moisture. So this is the Hydrate Conditioner, and I love it because the application was so smooth and really easy. This was the answer to my dryness of my hair. I just felt like it did beyond what I have imagined it could do. It gave my hair the moisture that it needed, and I was able to detangle and get the knots out. Now my hair feels light. It feels fresh. Because of Vegamour, I spend less time struggling with my hair and more time loving it.
