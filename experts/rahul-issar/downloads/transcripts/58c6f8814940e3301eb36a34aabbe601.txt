The V34 product is so strong that yellow stains melt away upon application, and when it comes in contact with teeth it immediately brightens them. Imagine that this yellow balloon is a yellow stain. If I use the color purple, I can cancel out the yellow stain. Bleaching or whitening teeth is fundamentally about reducing the yellow tones of your teeth. Color correction achieves a similar very desirable effect because it also reduces the yellow appearance of teeth, but it does so instantly. With color correcting, the result is entirely on the surface. Nothing is penetrating in, so it is entirely painless and causes zero sensitivity. So effectively, you are getting a painless and effective solution for yellow teeth. Proprietary blend of dyes that V34 uses effectively erases the appearance of yellow, so it's something that you can paint on, and instantly the appearance of teeth look very much whiter.
