Check out the arms. My arms look way bigger than they actually are. I'm six foot two, 190 pounds. This is a size large. I want it simple, I want it to fit nice and look good. Fresh, clean threads, checks all those boxes. I can lift my arms up without showing my belly. I'm 6'3, I can't do that in a normal shirt. It's not too tight, it's not too baggy, it's just right. The fits are super consistent, like everything I've ordered has fit exactly the same way. And they're super affordable too. They're super soft, high quality material. Each shirt fits perfectly, it's like it's tailored just for you. Don't just take my word for it, go check them out.
