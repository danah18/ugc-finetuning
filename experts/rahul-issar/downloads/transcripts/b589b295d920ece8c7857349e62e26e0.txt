These bins have to be the most disgusting thing in the modern kitchen. And yet we all put up with it. So our government wants us to believe that the little bin is the best solution we have to kitchen waste. And yet, this is how we deal with our food waste? We're still doing the garbage like it's 1920. Is this about us, or is this about keeping all the garbage trucks on the roads? Lomi is going to be the only carbon negative appliance you own. That's a pretty big deal. Yes, Lomi plugs in, and yes, it's going to use more energy than worms or chickens or a backyard compost.
