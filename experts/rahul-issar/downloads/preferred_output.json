So our government wants us to believe that the little bin is the best solution we have to kitchen waste. And yet, this is how we deal with our food waste? We're still doing the garbage like it's 1920. Is this about us, or is this about keeping all the garbage trucks on the roads? Lomi is going to be the only carbon negative appliance you own. That's a pretty big deal. Yes, Lomi plugs in, and yes, it's going to use more energy than worms or chickens or a backyard compost.

Right team, here we go, we've got the old High Smile V34 colour correct. Let's put on the old chops, see how they look currently. So, we'll see how we go. Let's check it out. Oh, they look white. Let's go!", "58c6f8814940e3301eb36a34aabbe601.mp4": "The V34 product is so strong that yellow stains melt away upon application, and when it comes in contact with teeth it immediately brightens them. Imagine that this yellow balloon is a yellow stain. If I use the color purple, I can cancel out the yellow stain. Bleaching or whitening teeth is fundamentally about reducing the yellow tones of your teeth. Color correction achieves a similar very desirable effect because it also reduces the yellow appearance of teeth, but it does so instantly. With color correcting, the result is entirely on the surface. Nothing is penetrating in, so it is entirely painless and causes zero sensitivity. So effectively, you are getting a painless and effective solution for yellow teeth. Proprietary blend of dyes that V34 uses effectively erases the appearance of yellow, so it's something that you can paint on, and instantly the appearance of teeth look very much whiter.", "48500f6094faa624d1f33ad28ff66de3.mp4": "I finally found curly hair products that I love. I can't stop touching my curls. They feel so soft and hydrated. My curls have never looked this defined on day two. I kept seeing this free hair consultation by Proz on TikTok. I told Proz my curl pattern, hair texture, problem areas, and current hair routine. And boom, they custom made this shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, hair oil, and styling gel just for me. I can't believe my curls became this healthy and gorgeous in just a few washes. I detangle my hair in five minutes without losing much hair. My curls last up to four days now and they never feel weighed down or crunchy. My formula has amazing ingredients like rice water, okra, apple cider vinegar, instead of playing the guessing game with my curls. Proz did all the work for me.

Okay, so this is the curl cream, and this is going to give me the curls I'm looking for and help me style my hair. My curls are already looking bouncy. Wow. My hair is finally dry.

It doesn't matter what shampoo you use because so many people believe all shampoo are the same. They end up buying generic products that don't work. But many shampoo brands save costs with harsh, irritating chemicals, low-quality ingredients, and one-size-fits-all formulas. This makes hair dry, dull, and super frizzy, and leaves scalp oily, itchy, and even flaky. It's time to break up with your old shampoo and start new with Proz. Proz customizes products for your unique hair type, texture, and length, free from over 1,300 EU banned ingredients, formulated to smooth hair, fight breakage, and restore shine, so you can say goodbye to dryness, damage, and flakes, so that your hair becomes stronger, longer, and healthier in just a couple washes."}
