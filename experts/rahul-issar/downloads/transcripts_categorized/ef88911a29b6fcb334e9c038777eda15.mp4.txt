Proz, personalized/custom shampoo for individual hair type and needs, It's crazy people still believe this about shampoo. It doesn't matter what shampoo you use because so many people believe all shampoo are the same. They end up buying generic products that don't work. But many shampoo brands save costs with harsh, irritating chemicals, low-quality ingredients, and one-size-fits-all formulas. This makes hair dry, dull, and super frizzy, and leaves scalp oily, itchy, and even flaky. It's time to break up with your old shampoo and start new with Proz. Proz customizes products for your unique hair type, texture, and length, free from over 1,300 EU banned ingredients, formulated to smooth hair, fight breakage, and restore shine, so you can say goodbye to dryness, damage, and flakes, so that your hair becomes stronger, longer, and healthier in just a couple washes.
