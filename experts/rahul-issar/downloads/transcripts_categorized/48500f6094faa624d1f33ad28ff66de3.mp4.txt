Proz, custom hair care products for curly hair based on personalized consultation, I finally found curly hair products that I love. I can't stop touching my curls. They feel so soft and hydrated. My curls have never looked this defined on day two. I kept seeing this free hair consultation by Proz on TikTok. I told Proz my curl pattern, hair texture, problem areas, and current hair routine. And boom, they custom made this shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, hair oil, and styling gel just for me. I can't believe my curls became this healthy and gorgeous in just a few washes. I detangle my hair in five minutes without losing much hair. My curls last up to four days now and they never feel weighed down or crunchy. My formula has amazing ingredients like rice water, okra, apple cider vinegar, instead of playing the guessing game with my curls. Proz did all the work for me. Take the consultation now.
