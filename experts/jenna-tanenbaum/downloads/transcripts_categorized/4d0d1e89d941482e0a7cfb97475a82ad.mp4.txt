}, I really respect public school special ed teachers, but they're overworked. I was meeting with my child's special ed teacher the other day when it dawned on me the volume of individualized education plans that teachers have to create. How can it really be individualized when they're managing them for over 20 kids? That's when I decided it was time I started homeschooling Claire. I realized I could take on my student's IEP on my own with a program like Time for Learning, where I can define the accommodation myself. It's been such a relief. It's super easy to navigate and create a plan that is actually personalized to Claire's needs. The amount of control that we have over the pacing and what my student is learning is what makes Time for Learning work for us. If you're looking to give your student a real individualized education program, I highly recommend heading to timeforlearning.com.
