}, Kid isn't misbehaving. They're just stuck in a system that wasn't built for them. Our lives totally changed when we started homeschooling with Time4Learning. Truly, no disrespect to teachers. It's just impossible for one person to take into account all the individual needs of 20-some-odd students in a room. Kids are different, but they all deserve a quality education that works for them. That's why I can't recommend Time4Learning enough. I feel like he's calmer, happier, and actually interested in learning. There's so many ways to learn. Time4Learning recognizes that and adapts to suit your student. Check them out at time4learning.com.
