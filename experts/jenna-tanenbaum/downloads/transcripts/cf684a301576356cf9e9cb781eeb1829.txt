Can you believe that this was us on an average Tuesday morning? Thanks to homeschooling with Time for Learning, we get to decide how our day is organized. That means we can supplement lessons with activities that actually enhance what my kid is learning. The world doesn't just exist in a classroom, so why aren't we giving kids everything? All the lessons that life has to offer. Plus, it's fun! Thanks to the flexibility of the Time for Learning curriculum, we can plan out where and when my child does her work.
