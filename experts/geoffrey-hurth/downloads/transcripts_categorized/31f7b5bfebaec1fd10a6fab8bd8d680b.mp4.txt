}, Let's unbox my personalized skincare routine from Curology. So I've been using Curology for a little over a year now, and I've seen such a significant improvement in my skin. Here's a picture of my skin before Curology, and this is what it looks like now. So as you can see, all those bumps and texture that I was really concerned about are almost non-existent. First item that we have here is the Curology lip balm. I'm going to sound dramatic when I say this, but this is the best lip balm to ever exist. And it's just like super cool. Now let's get into my routine. First is the Curology 2% salicylic acid body wash. This has helped my back knee so much. Next is the cleanser. It's just a really nice gentle cleanser. I also ordered the micellar water. Emergency spot patches. These work so well. The rich moisturizer. And last but not least, my customized formula. When you join Curology, you get your own personal provider. You send them pictures of your skin, let them know what your concerns are, and using that information, they customize a formula that's right for you. Honestly, the best part about it all is that this is all shipped right to your door. I don't have to go to the grocery store anymore when I'm running low on my skincare. Because before I even run out, the next shipment's already at my door. You can go sign up for a free 30-day trial right now. Come back and tell me what you think because I have nothing but good things to say about Curology.
