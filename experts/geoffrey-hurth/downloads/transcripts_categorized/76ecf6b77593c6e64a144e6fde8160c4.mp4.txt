}, I did the Truebill challenge and it worked! I saved $100 each month. This is how much I saved this month by cutting down on things that I don't even use anymore. I hopped on the Truebill app and it showed me all of my subscriptions along with how much they were costing me. I was almost paying 15 bucks on Netflix when I was sharing an account with my friend for like months. Okay, check this out. If I want to go ahead and cancel this account here, I'll just go ahead and click this button and that's it. Canceled! I wish I found out about this sooner.
