}, You are not ugly, you just have cortisol face, and lowering your cortisol levels is literally the easiest way to have a glow up. I'm talking face snatched, waist snatched, no longer worrying about the little things that used to stress you out, feeling refreshed in the morning, and the best part, I don't crave sweets after a meal anymore. And this is formulated to help reduce your cortisol levels. This has ashwagandha, L-theanine, vitamin D3, and magnesium glycinate, and it literally tastes like raspberry lemonade with no other BS ingredients in it. These packets have been going crazy viral on TikTok, so if you see the orange shopping cart down there, that means they're still available, and I highly recommend grabbing some before they sell out. So good.
