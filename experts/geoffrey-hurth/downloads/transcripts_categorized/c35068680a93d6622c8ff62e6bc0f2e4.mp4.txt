}, The biggest I've ever been, I was 178 pounds. And then once I started the obvi, I started doing calorie deficit. I got down to 147 within three months. Wow, that's impressive. And then I finally it took probably about after that, I wasn't trying as hard. And I was kind of falling off the wagon. So it took me probably about seven or eight months to get down to 118 pounds. Your results are incredible, though. That's absolutely mind blowing. I worked hard. Because I looked, I couldn't take pictures of myself. I was too ashamed. I wish I had had some before photos though now, but I couldn't even see my feet. Oh, you poor thing.
