}, How I found out my perfect bedtime was 11:37. I was literally sleeping from 4am to 3pm every day. Then my roommate told me about Rise. It works by connecting to your sleep data. It tells you how much sleep debt that you're in, when to go to bed, and when to wake up based on your biorhythms. After two days using this app, I started waking up at 10am. After eight days, I was up at 6am and working out feeling like a superhero. It's proven to work, and if you download it now, you'll thank me later.
