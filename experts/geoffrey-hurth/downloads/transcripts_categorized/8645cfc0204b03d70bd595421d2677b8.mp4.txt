}, So I've been using Curology for a little over a year now, and I've seen such a significant improvement in my skin. Here's a picture of my skin for Curology, and this is what it looks like now. So as you can see, all those bumps and textures that I was really concerned about are almost non-existent. When you join Curology, you get your own personal provider. You send them pictures of your skin, let them know what your concerns are, and using that information, they customize a formula that's right for you. Honestly, the best part about it all is that this is all shipped right to your door. You can go sign up for a free 30-day trial right now. Come back and tell me what you think, because I have nothing but good things to say about Curology.
