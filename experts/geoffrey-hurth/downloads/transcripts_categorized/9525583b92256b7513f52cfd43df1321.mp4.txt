}, If you have PCOS, inflammatory issues, you feel like you're bloating most of the time, then you need to have certain supplements in your life. I take supplements every single day and I make sure I do not skip because I definitely 100% notice a difference in my life. I take magnesium, vitamin D, those two go really well together. B12, any sort of vitamin C, you just have to get it all in your body. If there's something that you need to add into your routine, I would highly recommend a probiotic. Symbiotica's probiotics are amazing. A probiotic is pretty much key to having a proper gut and proper health, so everything comes from inside out, you know what I mean? If you want really good gut health, then I definitely recommend checking these out. These are really good.
