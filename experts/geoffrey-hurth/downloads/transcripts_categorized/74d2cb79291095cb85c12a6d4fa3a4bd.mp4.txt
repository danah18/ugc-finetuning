}, This is my number one gut health purchase of 2024. I've struggled with gut issues for years and wanted to find natural supplements to add to my routine. I came across this Manuka honey from Manukora and I immediately had to try it. When you open the box, you can tell how quality everything is. I even got free travel packs and saved $25 on my first order. Its smooth, velvety texture and caramel flavor are exquisite. It's only been a week and my gut feels better than ever. We add them to our breakfast in the morning and tea at night. I've also been having so much more energy. We even use it to help boost our immunity during cold season. We've told all our friends and now they use it too. I'm about to order some for my daughter. Hurry and get yours today.
