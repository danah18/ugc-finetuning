}, Hey, look at this, look at this. It costs $24,000 just to have health insurance in America. And I'm not even mad. When I was 19, me and 15 million other people got something known as Obamacare, aka the ACA Marketplace, right? You're not spending $24,000 here. Peep the monthly premium. Depending on your situation and location, you're spending $0 a month. And then let's look at the actual coverage. $0 to see a doctor, $0 to see a specialist, and absolutely nothing for medication, right? And it only takes like three minutes to sign up. It takes 30 seconds just to see all the plans that, like just what you see in the background here. And then another two and a half minutes to press that enroll button and put in your date of birth and your zip code and your address, and they'll send you your cards. You're done.
