}, If you are not going to a festival this summer, keep scrolling. These Happy Tuesdays bags are my secret weapon of feeling great after staying up all night. They have everything I need to support my mind and my body's recovery. They help me fall asleep naturally without having to use sleeping pills or anything like that. And they give me more energy and I am more focused at work. I feel sharper and more productive. Plus, they are super convenient. They come in a single serving sachet so they are easy to bring with me when I go out or on vacation or go to a festival. Each pack contains 26 nutrients in doses that actually do something. And a pack costs about the price of a drink on a night out. But these are way better for you. Oh, and at first I thought, the reviews must be, pardon my French, bull****. No, they're not. They're not. They work. And yes, they are an actual game changer. So yeah, public service announcement to all party people. Go stock up on those. Thank me later.
