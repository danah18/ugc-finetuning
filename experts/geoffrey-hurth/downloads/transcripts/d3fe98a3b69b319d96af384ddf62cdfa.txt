So this was a picture I took about a month ago before I realized that I had high cortisol levels. I had seen all the girlies on TikTok talking about like, oh, you just have cortisol face. Like, are you chubby or do you have cortisol face? And I was like, do I? They claimed that this Nello super calm stuff would like snatch your face, snatch your waist. I was like, I kind of want to give it a try. I thought it literally couldn't hurt. And if that's what's going on, I want a snatch jawline. I didn't realize it was going to fix 99% of my problems. First of all, check out the jaw. She's cute. She's snatched. Not only that, but my pants are fitting better. I no longer crave sweets. I no longer overthink the little things. My mood is more stable. Like it was getting out of hand. And I'm not saying that's the issue you have as well, but if it is, why not just give it a try? None of us want to be going out this summer worrying if we literally have like a giant like bulge sitting under our jawline. If it's not absolutely necessary. Plus it freaking tastes like pink lemonade. Okay. The only thing I will say that I don't love about this product is that it is constantly sold out. Like I can never get my hands on it. So they just put some back in stock. I grabbed like three bags. You've got to run if you're wanting to try this because it's going to be gone.
