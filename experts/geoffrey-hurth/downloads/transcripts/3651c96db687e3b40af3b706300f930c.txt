Quitting coffee changed my life. After breakfast, I can’t stay focused at all anymore. Yet, I’ve tried everything. Drinking way too much coffee and even taking a cold shower. But nothing works. And I discovered the Bonjour coffee alternative. It contains lion’s mane, which is the brain mushroom, and cordyceps, the athlete’s mushroom. Thanks to that, I stay focused all day long. So if you also want to work, drink Bonjour. No need to cross the street.
