They have very low battery life, you have to recharge them all the time, so the charger ends up lying around in the bathroom. When you go on vacation, it’s not practical, it leaves limescale marks and quite often, brushing is too harsh on your gums. And let’s be honest, the design isn’t really great either. And then there are the replacement heads you have to remember to buy, and finding the right model when you’re shopping. Otherwise, there’s the manual toothbrush, which is clearly less effective and doesn’t clean deeply. We don’t change it regularly enough, it becomes a real breeding ground for germs and loses effectiveness. So, let me introduce you to MyVariation. An electric toothbrush that has already won over more than 200,000 people who recommend it. With a rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Trustpilot. It was created by two brothers who wanted to revolutionize dental hygiene in France. It uses sonic technology, the brush head emits vibrations that replicate the vertical movement of a manual brush, but more effectively. There are 5 different brushing modes to suit all sensitivities. 91% of users say their brushing is less harsh on their gums than with their previous brush. It charges via USB-C, so goodbye to the charger lying around in the bathroom. Plus, it has a one-month battery life, so you can easily take it on vacation. It looks really cool, comes in 6 colors, and its sleek, streamlined design helps prevent grime and limescale stains. There’s an optional subscription system so you get replacement heads delivered straight to your mailbox.
