If I'm being honest, I think ADHD medications have missed the boat. Neurotransmitter they should be focusing on is acetylcholine. Took two of these Elevates, it's like freaking brain food. It was crazy how clear everything got. So I got interested. What's in this thing? You've got turmeric and you've got lion's mane in there. Adaptogens allow us to build neural pathways, new ones. You look at the next ingredient and that's where it got really interesting. It's got CDP choline. Acetylcholine is the future. If you want memory thinking processing, and everybody's just looking past it.
