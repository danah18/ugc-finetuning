These Chinese athletes, including this lady here, were accused of doping because they took this mushroom, cordyceps. I’m doing some research on this and I’m discovering some amazing things about mushrooms. It’s fascinating. Yet it’s a mushroom you can find in nature and there is nothing illegal about it whatsoever. It’s mostly known from a Netflix zombie series—I can’t remember what it’s called. There are even studies done on military personnel that say it could improve tolerance to high-intensity exercise. Personally, I’m taking it because I’m getting ready for a big event at the beginning of June. I’m going to need a lot of oxygen. You might ask what the connection is between oxygen and a mushroom. It’s said to reduce fatigue, help improve your VO2 max, of course while you’re training. Apart from giving you an energy boost, it also increases your libido. I think we’re going to be hearing a lot about this mushroom. Seriously, I encourage you to learn more about mushrooms. I’m taking the one from French Mush because it’s a French brand and organic. And for those who are interested, they’re offering us 10% off with the code Bananagang. If you stayed until the end, drop a little running man and a mushroom emoji for me. See you soon!
