I wish that I wasn't, needin' something
Wasn't getting over you
When I move to the side, when I move call you mind and I know what you're feeling
I'ma take you for a ride, let me take it off your mind cause you know it's a season
And I move, and I move, and I move when I'm right
And I move, and I move, and I move when I'm
And I move, and I move, and I move when I'm right
And I move, and I move when I'm, yeah
I guess you're tired of making me take your night
Predictin' it's all that I do cause yeah
I let you show, don't let you in on my life
I'll tell you the things
