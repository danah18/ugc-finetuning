Do you know what this is? No. It's a 900K deodorant that's effective for up to 48 hours. Okay, how do you use it? You need to open the container, snap the refill into the container, like this. Then you close it, and there you have your deodorant. It's much more eco-friendly because, as you already know, spray deodorants are not good for the planet. And most natural deodorants are not effective at all. This one is really an effective deodorant: you sweat, which is logical since it's a deodorant, but you don't smell any odor. So here you smell verbena, I don't know if you want to try. There are other scents too: rose, and the brown one as well. How much does it cost, more or less, for you? 25 euros. 12. It costs 5.90 euros. That's reasonable. Yeah, that's very good, yeah. So where can you find it? You can find it on 900k, the link is just below.
