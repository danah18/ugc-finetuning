Before, I was completely addicted to sugar and now I can go entire days without having any sugar. And Bebox has completely changed my life. It’s a fruit powder that makes all unsweetened foods taste sweet without any sugar. It’s extracted from the cystrée fruit, which grows in West Africa. It’s 100% natural, 100% fruit-based, calorie-free, and most importantly, sugar-free. So how does it work? You simply take a small pinch of the powder and suck on it like a candy. Then, for example, you can enjoy a plain yogurt—unsweetened, of course—and it’ll taste super sweet. It’s crazy. It’s incredible how, in just a few seconds, it really gives a sweet flavor. You think you’re eating a sweet yogurt, a fruit yogurt. Since I’ve started using it, I no longer crave sugar or nighttime snacking at all. So I can enjoy sweet treats but without sugar. Honestly, it works. Plus, they’re offering 15% off right now if you buy multiple products. So take advantage of it.
