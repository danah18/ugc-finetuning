This is my secret for replacing coffee. After several months of training with more than 20 hours of sports per week, I crossed the finish line at the Nice Ironman with a time of 12 hours and 58 minutes. Bonjour is an alternative to coffee that I used for some time before my Ironman. It helped me reduce my anxiety, stay focused on my goals, and reduce my fatigue. Itâ€™s a coffee rich in adaptogens and nutrients, and on top of that, it supports immunity. It has a sugar-free formula, an irresistible taste of cocoa and roasted grains, with only 21 calories per cup. If this makes you want to try it too, click the link just below to test it out.
