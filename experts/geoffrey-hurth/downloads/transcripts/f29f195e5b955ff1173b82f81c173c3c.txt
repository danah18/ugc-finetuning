Are we big backs or do we just have high cortisol? The girlies have been saying that lowering your cortisol levels is the easiest way to have a major glow up. And they weren't freaking joking. Our jawlines are snatched, extra puffiness is gone, our pants fitting better. There are many ways to go about this, but if you're lazy like me, these have been my favorite way of lowering my cortisol levels recently. They have ashwagandha, l-theanine, magnesium, vitamin D3, no sugar. I use these packets at night and I'm telling you there could be a literal tornado outside my window and I'm not waking up. I sleep so good now. The list goes on, but the one thing I actually dislike about these is the fact that they sell out so extremely quickly. So if you see the orange card below, it means they still have some left in stock and I would highly recommend grabbing yours before they're gone again.
