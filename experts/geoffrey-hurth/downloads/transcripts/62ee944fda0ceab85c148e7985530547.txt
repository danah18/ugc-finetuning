A flask is the ideal amount for a tasting for two people. The concept is really cool and on top of that, it looks very, very nice. You can discover great vintages from home that are rare, exclusive, and that you can't find at your usual supermarket, and you don't need to open around fifteen bottles to do a tasting of these wines.
