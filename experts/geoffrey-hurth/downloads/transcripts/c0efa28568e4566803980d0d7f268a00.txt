I've always been super self-conscious about my bikini line at the beach because of how bad it looked. I personally don't like pubic hair, so I shave it but always end up with nasty bumps and irritations which is so frustrating. Every time I go to the beach I am paranoid my bumps would be on show. Then I saw this viral skincare routine for the bikini line on TikTok and because I was so desperate I ordered it and oh my god. It comes with this cleanser, this exfoliator and this oil. They say you use these for 3 days and it's supposed to get rid of pubic ingrowns, bumps and irritations. I've been using it for just over a month now, 3 times a week and over the past week I have really started to see a noticeable difference. I cannot believe this as I have had bumps and ingrown hairs from shaving for years yet this seems to be doing the job already. If you're a shaver, you need this in your life.
