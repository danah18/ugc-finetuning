This powder contains twelve billion probiotics for your gut, which is five times as many as in yogurt and 123 times more than in kimchi. It also contains six grams of fiber and important vitamins like B6 and B12 for the immune system. That’s why Daily Gut is super effective for natural weight management and against bloating and constipation. But that’s not all—it tastes like your favorite childhood drink or goes perfectly with muesli or smoothies. This is the Daily Gut 2.0 from Brain Effect, and its health benefits are scientifically proven. But don’t just take my word for it—try it for yourself.
