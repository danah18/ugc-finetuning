Did you know that one in five people suffers from brittle nails in the winter? Because I do too. Disinfectants, gloves, heat, cold, dry air, being outside—all of that makes my nails quickly look like this. And nail polish alone can’t really hide it. And honestly, with the time and current prices, I don’t really want to go to a nail salon. But that’s where Do Nails comes in. Because with Do Nails, you have the option to do your nails at home, just like in a nail studio. And for that, you don’t need UV lamps, and they last up to three weeks. You apply a layer of base coat and then dip your nail in the base powder. After that, you apply the base coat again and this time dip your nail in the colored powder. You let everything harden with the activator and you seal it all with the top coat, the finishing layer. You can remove everything with the remover liquid from Do Nails.
