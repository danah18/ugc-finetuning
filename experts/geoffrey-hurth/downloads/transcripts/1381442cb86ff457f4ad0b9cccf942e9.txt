Alright, let me explain. Since I’m as quick to react as a sloth at the end of its career, I obviously missed the launch of the Lily Skin Silk Tédoreilles. But since I’m not the type to just sit back and pay full price either, I set out to score a little promo code and here’s what I found. For Black Friday, they’re planning the biggest discounts in their history. More than ten new products at slashed prices, surprises, gifts, and guaranteed access to the sale two hours before everyone else. So if you want to get all your Christmas gifts without sending your banker into a panic, there’s just one condition: sign up for their VIP list for free. So hurry up and click just below, spots are limited. Alright, kisses!
