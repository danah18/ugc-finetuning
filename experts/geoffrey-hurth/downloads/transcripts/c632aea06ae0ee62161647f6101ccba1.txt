Did you all see that video of this girl talking about how she had so many different stomach issues and chronic pain and she was going to doctors, ran so many tests, and nobody could figure out what was wrong with her? Well, it turned out that her gut issues were actually caused by her morning coffee. And this is actually the case with so many different people, but I think a lot of us don't realize that the pain that we're feeling within our stomach is actually caused by what we all drink almost every morning, which is coffee. In the video, she explains that she decided to make the switch to this brand, which is Four Sigmatic, because they use a coffee that has a mushroom blend in it with lion's mane and then chaga mushroom extract. And that chaga mushroom extract has immune boosting properties, which really helps you not have those effects of normal coffee on your stomach. So like she said in her video, if you have a lot of gut and stomach issues, this is definitely a coffee that you should give a try.
