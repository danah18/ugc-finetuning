Okay, total panic this morning—I ran out of coffee at home. Hello! Today I’m taking you along on my morning routine for an ultra-productive day. Let’s go! I woke up super early, and whenever I have a lot to do, I get so stressed I can’t sleep. I had no coffee at home and I think I’m not the only one; it’s impossible to start my day without coffee. It was too early so all the coffee shops near me were closed. But then I remembered I had a brand-new bag of Bonjour in my cupboard, so I figured it was the perfect occasion to try it out. It’s a coffee alternative made with adaptogenic mushrooms. It literally took me a second to make it—look. I put a spoonful in a cup, add hot water, stir, and that’s it, ready. So then I tasted it—I really didn’t know what to expect because I’m super picky. Oh wow, it’s so good! It’s honestly a flavor I’ve never tried before and you can’t find it anywhere else. It’s kind of a mix between cocoa and roasted grains—it’s incredible, I’m a fan. Inside, there are adaptogenic mushrooms, barley, and cocoa, everything is organic and there’s zero sugar so that’s great. The recipe is really designed to give more energy than coffee, help you stay focused, and have clearer ideas—all without the side effects of coffee. That’s perfect for me because coffee makes me super jittery, and honestly I crash all the time during the day. Okay, I was able to work all day without a single slump, so I think I’m going to replace my coffee with Bonjour. You should try it, bye!
