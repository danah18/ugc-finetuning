Alright, let me explain. Since I’m as reactive as a sloth at the end of its career, I obviously missed the launch of Liviskin’s silk pillowcases. A brand I love and literally talk to you about all the time. But since I’m not the type to just accept that and pay full price either, I went looking for a little promo code and here’s what I found out. For Black Friday, they’re planning the biggest discounts in their history. More than ten new products at rock-bottom prices, surprises, gifts, and guaranteed access to the sale two hours before everyone else. So if you want to get all your Christmas gifts without putting your banker in cardiac arrest, there’s just one condition. Sign up for free to their VIP list. So hurry up and click just below, spots are limited. Alright, kisses!
