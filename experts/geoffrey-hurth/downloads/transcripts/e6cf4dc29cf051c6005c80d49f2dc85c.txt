How much should a solar system actually cost at most in 2023? If you’ve ever been to a solar installer, they probably told you something like supply shortages, demand is so high that any price could be justified, or even a shortage of raw materials. This will lead to systems simply being difficult to deliver right now. Many homeowners want to get solar technology on their roof quickly, so they accept high prices. What you can easily do to avoid all this is compare offers. Please compare. The government is still subsidizing solar very attractively. High feed-in tariffs and VAT is waived. Still, you don’t have to pay any price for it. If this whole topic is relevant for you, then I can recommend the free solar check from Hausfrage.
