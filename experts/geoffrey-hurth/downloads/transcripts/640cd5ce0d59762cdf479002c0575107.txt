You know those mornings when nothing goes as planned? Well, today was exactly like that. Hello, today I'm taking you through my morning routine for an ultra-productive day. Let’s go: I woke up super early and when I have tons to do, I get so stressed that I can’t sleep. I ran out of coffee at home and I think I’m not the only one—it’s impossible for me to start my day without coffee. It was too early so all the coffee shops near me were closed. But then I remembered I had a brand new sachet of bonjour in my cupboard, so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to try it. It’s a mushroom-based adaptogen coffee alternative. It literally took me a second to make, watch: I put a spoonful in a cup, add hot water, stir, and voilà, it’s ready! Now I’m tasting it, I had no idea what to expect because I’m super picky. Oh wow, it’s so good! It’s honestly a flavor I’ve never tried before and you can’t find it anywhere else. It’s a mix between cocoa and roasted grains, it’s amazing, I’m a fan. So in it, there are adaptogen mushrooms, barley, and cocoa, everything is organic and there’s zero sugar so that’s great. The recipe is really designed to give you more energy than coffee, help you focus better, make your mind clearer, and all that without the unwanted side effects of coffee. Which is perfect for me because coffee makes me super jittery and honestly, I always get energy crashes throughout the day. Okay, I was able to work all day without a single slump, so I think I’m going to swap my coffee for bonjour, you should try it, bye!
