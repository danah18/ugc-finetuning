So people ask me how a soap works on a human body. It's extremely simple. When you wash yourself with a soap, any soap has the ability to very slightly lift the hydrolipidic film that you have on your body. Now, the hydrolipidic film is our last protection against all external elements. It is what maintains our hydration and we are covered with it from head to toe. When you wash with soap, it lifts this film, and when you rinse off in the shower, the hydrolipidic film goes down the drain along with the dirt that was on it. This is called the primary function, the cleansing function.

The other function of soap, which is less well-known, is the moisturizing function. You may have noticed that with commercial soaps, fundamentally, they have a cleansing function, but they have very little moisturizing function. We always have a feeling of tight skin, of dry skin when we wash with a commercial soap. That’s normal; it’s intentional. It creates a need for hydration. What will you do next? You’ll go buy their moisturizing cream or lotion because you feel the need to hydrate, you feel your skin is dry.

Not with a Castile soap. With a Castile soap, it rebuilds your lipid protection in about a minute. So you come out of the shower without any feeling of tightness, dryness, tingling, or redness. That’s also the difference between a commercial soap and a Castile soap.
