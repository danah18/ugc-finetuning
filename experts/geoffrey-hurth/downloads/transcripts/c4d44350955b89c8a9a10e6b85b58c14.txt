If you have crazy pain during your period, listen to me carefully because this will change your life. I co-founded a brand called Kanaya, which offers pain-relief patches made from natural ingredients. As soon as you feel pain, just place the patch where it hurts. It works within minutes and you can keep it on for 24 hours. Hundreds of women have already tried and approved it, so it could very well be the solution for you too. Go to kanaya.fr to place your first order.
