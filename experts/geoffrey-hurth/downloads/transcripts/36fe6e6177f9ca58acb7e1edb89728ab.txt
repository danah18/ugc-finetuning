I mean, honestly, look at how stunning she looks. Today I'm going to show you the basic techniques you need to look your very best using Jones Road. First, add what the foundation. Even out your skin, get rid of redness. I do the brush and then I gently pat with the fingers. The next step is face pencil. That is the color of your skin. Often it's redness around the nose. If you see I'm using the tapping motion instead of rubbing. Always tap. Next, I'm going to fill in the brows with the brow pencil. I'm going to prep the eyes with a light powdered shadow. Gets rid of any excess oil so your eye shadow doesn't crease. What I love most about this mascara, it really makes your eyes pop. You can add more coats later if you're going out in the evening and just need a refresh. Now I'm going to use the best blush in Sandy and then a little bit of a pop of brighter pink. The Miracle Balm in Magic Hour, which is one of my favorites to add luminosity, layered right on top of the best blush.
