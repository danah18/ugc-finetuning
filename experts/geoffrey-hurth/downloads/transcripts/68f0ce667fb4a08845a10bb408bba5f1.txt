How I became a morning person when I was burned out. I felt exhausted and out of control all the time. Then my roommate told me about Rise. It's the only app that knows your sleep debt based on your phone's data. I found out I was 17.3 hours in sleep debt, and that my perfect bedtime for laser focus is 11:37. After eight days, I was up at 6 a.m., walking the dog, working out, and finishing my work day by 3 p.m. It's created by sleep scientists and proven to work.
