I just got back from my first session at AST, let me tell you about it. I went to AST, a center specialized in the latest anti-aging innovations. The assessment starts with a precise skin analysis using the Vizia machine and taking photos. Then, I spoke with an AST expert who suggested a personalized protocol for me. I found their approach very human. I felt confident, so I went for it. The treatment was quick and ended with a milk session. I am super happy with the results and my experience. I highly recommend AST. Like me, you can book your first informative consultation at ast.com
