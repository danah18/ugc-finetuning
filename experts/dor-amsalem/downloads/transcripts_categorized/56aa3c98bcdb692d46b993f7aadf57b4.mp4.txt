}, I'm 43 years old and I'm aging naturally. No retinol, no Botox. I used to use retinol and then a friend of mine told me about the effects. I discovered bamboo earth and now I have been all natural for a few years now. I didn't look this young at 30. No retinol, no injections, no nasty preservatives. Ditch the retinol, ditch the harsh chemicals, and ditch the water-based products. Waterless skincare is the secret to a natural, nourishing routine. What is waterless skincare? If you've been taught your whole life to avoid oils, you've been taught wrong. Don't worry, it's not your fault. Marketing tactics are really powerful and companies have been trying to convince people to buy oil-free products for a long time. Oil has actually been key for my already oily skin. I use bamboo earth's moisturizer and it's been amazing. The truth is, oil products actually do help your skin get a better cleanse without disrupting your skin's protective barrier. I highly recommend this product.
