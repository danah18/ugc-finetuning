}, Y'all wanted to know where the shoes are from? I got you. The brand is Charik Shoes and I came across them at a craft fair up in DC. They're made with full grain leather and have a memory foam insole, each pair is handmade and they scratched my loafer itch and then some. I was having a hard time deciding on a nice leather shoe that I could dress up or down and these did just that for me. There's definitely a break-in period like any leather shoe, but I was surprised at how comfy they were. I wear a 42 in these, but I'm normally a 10.5 in normal sizing. If you want a versatile shoe to elevate your outfits, these are a great choice.
