}, This is the power of custom hair formulas. I love how my hair looks when I leave the salon, but I can never seem to get the same result at home. After washing and styling my hair at home, it always ends up looking less defined, feels crunchy, and the style never lasts long before it gets frizzy. That's when I went to my stylist for help. She asked me if I heard of Prose. By answering a few questions about my hair, goals, and lifestyle, Prose made custom products just for me. I was sent custom shampoo with hydrolyzed okra extract, which will help reduce my unwanted frizz. Next, we tried my custom curl cream, which is going to give me the perfect level of definition I was looking for. Lastly, we used the custom styling gel and hair oil. My styling gel was customized to the hold level I was looking for. I love the final product. My hair feels softer, and my curls are so much more defined. Thank you, Prose.
