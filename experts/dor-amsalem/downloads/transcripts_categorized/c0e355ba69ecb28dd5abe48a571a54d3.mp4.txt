}, Okay, so this headline caught my eye, and it turns out that the skillet featured in this article is used by Michelin star chefs. The article goes on to say that any chef will tell you that you need a quality skillet, and recommends this ProBond nonstick skillet by Hestan. Not only is it handcrafted in Italia, but I can personally confirm it's durable and the nonstick coating actually lasts compared to other brands I've tried. Basically, the Michelin star chef then goes on to praise the pan. He mentions that it heats up quickly and also evenly across the pan, which is huge. Overall, the ProBond nonstick skillet by Hestan is just an absolute workhorse. I can't recommend enough.
