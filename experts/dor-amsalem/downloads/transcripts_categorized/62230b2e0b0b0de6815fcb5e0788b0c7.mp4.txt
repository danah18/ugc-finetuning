}, I used to suffer from the worst digestive issues ever. I couldn't go out for a meal, date night, you know, night out with friends without being so bloated. Stephanie, she's my co-founder and my wife, and like, we'd go out for dinners and then obviously we would eat a lot of amazing yet bloating foods and we would like come home because the bloating was so bad. We realized that this was a problem not just for me, but for basically every friend that I had too. That's why we came up with this guy here, Bloat. When we set out to create this product, we said, okay, we really want the product to be so effective that you feel the effects of it within an hour. Selfishly for me, I wanted to be able to go out to eat and not have to come home or have to unbutton my jeans after eating. To really make sure that the product worked, we actually ran clinical trials on the product. Third party clinical trials. We worked with a naturopathic doctor and have a medical board that formulated this product. It really is so efficacious and we're so excited for you to try it.
