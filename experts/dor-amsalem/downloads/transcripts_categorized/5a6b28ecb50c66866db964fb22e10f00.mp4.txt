}, Call me an astronaut because my boobs are experiencing zero-g, mama. Look at this. And all of that, wire-free. My other booby sizes, you are beautiful, we love you, but this is for the itty-bitty girlies. I have had pepper bras before. I've experienced the comfort. I've experienced the lift. This is something else. And always, no gaps. There will never be a gap in sight. Again, wire-free. Their bras are comfortable. They always will be, but this wire-free, like, look at all this. You have all this room for movement. Anyway, I'll give you, my necklace is disappearing in my cleavage. That is a sentence I never thought I'd have the privilege to say, but peekaboo. Boop, there it goes.
