}, Watch my son use CityPlay for his match day. CityPlay helps soccer players track a ton of stats with these two sensors you strap on your cleats. Put the sensors into the straps, wrap them around your heels like this, and then practice or play. All of your stats are loaded right into the app. I'm talking tracking touches, even down to which foot you use more, passes, how well you dribble, your kicking power, even top speed and total distance. It covers everything to show you exactly where you can improve. It's no wonder tons of clubs use them, like the Manchester City first team. If you or your child are really trying to improve, the CityPlay trackers are the perfect thing to get. Click below.
