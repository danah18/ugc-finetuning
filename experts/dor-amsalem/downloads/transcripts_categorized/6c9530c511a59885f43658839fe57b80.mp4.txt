}, I will never buy this pan again. You know why? It comes with a lifetime guarantee, so I won't need to. Hexclad cookware is truly everything it is hyped up to be. I have used plenty of metal utensils in them and there is not one single scratch. I was scared at first, but they truly are scratch resistant. The fact that I can put these pots and pans in the dishwasher has been an absolute lifesaver. The beautiful sear and caramelization I get with these is so superior to any other nonstick I have ever used. So now I'm down to only three pots and three pans. They're all used and they are all hexclad. This cookware sells itself. If you cook as much as I do, they are worth every single penny.
