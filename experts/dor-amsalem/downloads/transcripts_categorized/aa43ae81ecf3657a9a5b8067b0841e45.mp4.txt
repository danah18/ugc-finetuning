}, I hate how goggles leave marks on my skin. Getting goggle marks is a nightmare. I've tried so many products, but this eye gel from Trihard works like magic. I've been swimming for years, but I could never get rid of the post-swim puffiness. A teammate of mine told me about this eye gel, and it's a lifesaver. This ceramic stone applicator feels amazing on the skin, and the gel protects my skin from goggle marks. I love using this before and after my swim sessions to keep my under eyes hydrated. After an hour of swimming, my under eyes feel great, and they don't look puffy at all. This is seriously a new staple in my swim routine. You have to check them out.
