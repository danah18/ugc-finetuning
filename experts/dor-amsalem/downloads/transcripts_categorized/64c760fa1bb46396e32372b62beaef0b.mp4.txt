}, Hey guys, it's Phoenix Ha at Affiliate World, just got off main stage. Look how insane this crowd is. And I'm going to walk through it just to show you. But I just want to let you know that last year, everyone was about partying and talking about all these big things. And this year, it was about networking. It was about relationships. I sat here and had two hour conversations with people wanting to learn, wanting to grow. And if you do want to grow, come here. If you just want to have a good time, you can do that too. But you have access to some of the best people here. You have Nick Shackelford. You have Mark Joyner. You have Jason Akitip. You have Jordan Menard. All these insane marketers willing to give you everything that they've ever learned and give it to you right in your hands. So happy to be here and I want to see you guys next year.
