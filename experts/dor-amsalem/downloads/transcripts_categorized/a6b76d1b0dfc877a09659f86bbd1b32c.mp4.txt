  "product_description": "HexClad offers cookware, specifically pots and pans, known for their durable, scratch-resistant surfaces that allow the use of metal utensils, are dishwasher safe, and provide superior searing and caramelization compared to traditional nonstick cookware."
}, Gordon Ramsay said this is the perfect gift for home cooks. HexClad's surface really is everything it's hyped up to be. I have used plenty of metal utensils in them and I don't see a single scratch. And the fact that you can put these in the dishwasher has been an absolute lifesaver when I'm in a hurry. That beautiful sear and the caramelization I get with these is truly so much better than any nonstick I have ever used. So now I'm actually down to only three pots and three pans, and they're all HexClad. Overall, I am a huge fan and I'm 100% going to gift this to everyone I know.
