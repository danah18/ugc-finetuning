}, I'm not taking my skin fitness as seriously as I take my physical fitness. And that's where this face cream from Particle comes in. It covers all my basic skincare needs. It's six in one, the only thing you need for your skin. It soothes and moisturizes your skin. It prevents eye bags. It prevents wrinkles. It prevents dark spots. It doesn't irritate my eyes the way that my last skin cream did. I just apply it once in the morning, once at night. Simple. The best part is it's super inexpensive. Everything is in this one bottle. Pretty much perfect. Particle Men's Face Cream.
