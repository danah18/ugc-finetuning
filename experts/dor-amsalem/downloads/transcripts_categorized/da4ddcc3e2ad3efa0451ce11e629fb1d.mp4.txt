}, The biggest beauty mistake I see women over 50 making is using the wrong kind of makeup. As we age, our skin tends to lose moisture and we all get lines. Traditional makeup make us look older. Powders can be drying and heavy. Foundation could be too flat, making your skin look worse. We need something different. We need something moisturizing that gives a bit of color to counteract dullness and gives our skin life. That's why so many women love Miracle Balm. Miracle Balm is a hybrid makeup and skincare that has moisturizing ingredients like jojoba oil to nourish your skin. The moisture is what prevents it from sinking into fine lines and gives you a healthy glow. It's easy to apply. All you need to do is break the seal, tap it on, and you're out the door. We have 10 shades and you could take the quiz I made to find your shade. If you don't love it, you have 30 days free exchange or return, no questions asked. I recommend you take the quiz to try our Miracle Balm.
