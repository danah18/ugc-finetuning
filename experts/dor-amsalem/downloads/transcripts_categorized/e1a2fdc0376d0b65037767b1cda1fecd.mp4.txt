It is designed to minimize the risk of infection and tears compared to traditional derma rollers, and aims to stimulate collagen and elastin while enhancing serum absorption for improved skin appearance."
}, When my patients ask about at-home derma rollers as a dermatologist, I tell them no. Mostly due to risk of infection and tears in the skin. You see, the needles enter the skin at an angle and they dull over time. Recently, Cure sent me their microneedling device that comes individually wrapped in sterile, minimizing the risk of infection. Because the system enters the skin perpendicular, it minimizes the risk of tears. So let's put it to the test. Cure is a unique type of microneedling called microinfusion. It uses gold-plated needles to stamp rejuvenating serums directly into the skin. Previously only offered in dermatology offices, Cure microinfusion is now available to use at home with two different serums to not only stimulate collagen and elastin, but also enhance the penetration of skin-boosting serums for an instant glow.
