  "product_description": "A new line of soaps inspired by the fresh, crisp scent of the outdoors and nature, available individually or in a four-pack with Sawtooth, designed to evoke the feeling of a refreshing hike and clean air."
}, Duke Cannon just launched these three new soaps. It's like that crisp breeze that hits you in the face when you're hiking that smells like fresh trees and absolutely no cell service. You know the smell when you get to the end of the trail and the views are amazing and the clean air just hits you in the face and you just feel relaxed? That's what these smell like. You can buy them individually or you can buy them in a four pack with Sawtooth and save eight bucks.
