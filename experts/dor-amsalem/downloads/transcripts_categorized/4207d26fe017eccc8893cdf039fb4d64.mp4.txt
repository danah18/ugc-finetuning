}, So, this is Remarkable 2. This device is uniquely designed for note-taking and sketching, combining the traditional feel of pen and paper with modern technology.

The Remarkable 2 is a thoughtfully designed device with an incredibly thin and lightweight profile. Portability is key as this tablet can easily be carried along with you throughout your busy day. One of its most striking features, though, is definitely the screen, which uses the latest technology to mimic the feel of writing on paper. It looks like a sheet of paper, and it feels like it too.
