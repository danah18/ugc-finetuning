}, Set me free or give me death, there ain't no other choices. When I lay down and go to sleep, I keep on hearing voices. Little whispers in my head, man, is you fake or loyal? I know why that death is on the baby, pick your poison. These little demons living underneath my bed, creeping. Know the real monster lives above them all, sleeping. That subtle breathing in your closet every single evening. Thought you'd never see me again, lust can be deceiving. When they hear the sound of the drum, they'll be saying, oh lord, here they come. Yeah, here we come. Here we come. Here we come. Here we come. I used to think that people die because they wicked nowadays. People want to see you dead because you gifted. Been ready for my tomb since I came up out the womb. So no matter what, I'm coming back and paying you a visit. Saw it coming, I predicted, but y'all wouldn't listen. No, you can't protect your bitches if you never burn bridges. Flip pages, went places, made changes, still dangerous. Now I'm back, altercation, hold still. I make your pain. Here we come. Here we come. Here we come. Here we come.
