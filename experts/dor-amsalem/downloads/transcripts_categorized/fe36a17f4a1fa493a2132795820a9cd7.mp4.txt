{'brand_name': 'HexClad', 'product_description': 'Durable, metal-utensil safe cookware with a unique surface that provides excellent searing and caramelization, is dishwasher safe, and designed to replace traditional nonstick pans.'}, I bet you can't do this with your nonstick pan. HexClad's surface really is everything it's hyped up to be. I have used plenty of metal utensils in them and I don't see a single scratch. And the fact that you can put these in the dishwasher has been an absolute lifesaver when I'm in a hurry. That beautiful sear and the caramelization I get with these is truly so much better than any nonstick I have ever used. So now I'm down to only three pots and three pans, and they're all HexClad. Overall, I am a huge fan. And if you cook as much as I do, they're worth every single penny, and then some.
