And yes, I know I look absolutely crazy. I have one lash done, one lash not done, and I'm going to show y'all how easy it is to put on Moxie Lash Magnetic Lashes and why everyone needs them right now. You are not going to want to miss this sale. It is Black Friday sales. It is here. It is now. It is happening with Moxie Lash, okay? It is happening. Biggest sale of the year with Moxie Lash is live. I've linked it above for y'all. Y'all need to go shop. I'm going to show y'all how easy these are to put on. Now, listen, lashes get a lot of bad rap because everybody's like, oh, they're so hard. There's glue. There's all these things. Y'all, lashes are the easiest thing when you're using Moxie Lash, okay? I look like a loon right now, fully aware, but y'all, this is literally what a lash can do for you. So if you have never worn a lash, maybe you're absolutely petrified of lashes, maybe lashes aren't for you, or so you thought, you've just not tried Moxie Lash yet. This is seriously the easiest magnetic lash you will ever use in your life. Do not go waste money on other lashes. There is no point. Don't try other magnetic lashes. Don't try other strip lashes. Nothing. Moxie Lash, because right now, all of these kits are $39, you guys. $39 for each of these kits. I'm going to go through. I'm going to show you my favorites, why I love each of them, but mainly I'm going to show y'all why I am obsessed with these and why these lashes have over 100,000 five-star reviews. Yeah. These lashes, Moxie Lash, has over 100,000 five-star reviews. There is a reason I am obsessed, and so is 100,000 other people. So let me show y'all how easy these are to put on. I'm going to be using the Sassy Kit today. If you know me, you know this is one of my favorite kits, along with the Wifey. Sassy and Wifey get used probably the most often in my house. These are definitely my favorites. So when you grab a lash kit, you're going to get a full-size liner, which I have already pulled out because I did apply. So you're going to get a full-size liner, full-size applicator, a mirror, and three different sets of lashes, okay? This is also a great option if you want to try a lash. Maybe you've never tried them before. You don't know what style you want to get. Great way to start. Or if you're like me and you have an unhealthy, in my opinion, it's a healthy obsession with lashes, you have all of the kits. So I'm going to show y'all really quick how easy these are to put on. Now, this magnetic liner is truly magnetic, you guys. There are a ton of magnetic lashes out there that claim they're magnetic, but they're like, oh, apply the liner and instantly put on your lashes. And I'm like, but that doesn't make sense because then everything's just drying together, right? Okay, that's where they get you. If you wait for their liners to dry, all these other companies, you wait for their liners to dry, they don't stick. They don't work. This, you wait for it to dry, you pop on the lashes, you can feel them stick, you can feel the hold. It is so strong, it is so good, and they're gonna last you all day. So we're gonna go in with the Moxie Lash Black Magnetic Liner and we are gonna line this. Now, if you notice, I don't have anything laid down. You do not have to be good at makeup. You do not have to be good at lashes. You don't even have to be good at liner to do this because even if your line's not straight, your lash is gonna cover it, okay? So we're gonna do a quick little line and I'm kind of like a little generous with this. I like to make sure that I have what I need and so you can take a little bit at a time and then apply it where you need it. Now, I'm gonna start with the outer corner of my eye and then work my way to the inner corner just like this. And you can also lay the brush down on its side to kind of help cover more territory if you're someone who cannot draw a straight line really well, you can lay it down on its side and it makes life so much easier. Now, I do not have contacts. I am one of those unfortunate people who cannot wear them. However, my sister-in-law, I wish she was here to tell y'all, she is a avid contact wearer and these are the only lashes that do not give her issues with her contacts. How amazing these can be worn with glasses. Now, if you get super long lashes, let's be honest, some of them are gonna touch your glasses. But the cool thing about Moxie Lash is that they offer so many styles that you can find lashes that aren't gonna touch your glasses, okay? So, with our liner, we're gonna let this set for three minutes, okay? That is the key with this liner. Three minutes is your golden rule with Moxie Lash, okay? If you let this liner sit for three minutes, you're gonna have lashes that last all day, guaranteed, okay? So, three minutes on the shot clock. Now, what I do get a lot of questions about is how is this not adding more time into your makeup routine? I don't have time to put on false lashes. I don't have time to add this into my makeup routine. Yes, you do, and let me show you why. This took me all of maybe 15 seconds. Guess what? I need to apply my mascara. So, I'm gonna grab my favorite mascara. If you can hear my dog, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna put on my favorite mascara and go ahead and put that on. This is gonna help everything blend really effortlessly, really nicely with those false lashes. This is also going to allow time for your magnetic liner to dry for that three minutes, okay? So, you can do this. You can also pop on a lipstick if you don't have a lipstick. Finish your makeup routine. Go brush your hair. Go curl your hair. Everybody has, literally y'all, this liner, while it takes three minutes to dry, it does not add three minutes into your routine, okay? It just does it. If you choose to sit here and do nothing, then maybe it does. But you can literally line your lash. Go put on the rest of your makeup. Go change your clothes. Go curl your hair. It truly adds probably, I would say, a total of about 30 seconds into your routine between lining your lash and then sitting back down and popping it on. These are seriously the easiest lashes to apply, and right now, every single one of these lash kits is $39. So, it's kind of like, let me put this into perspective for you guys. If you were to purchase, oh, goodness. If you were to purchase one box of Moxie lashes, right? These are $39, okay? This whole kit's $39. You're getting three sets of lashes, the liner, the applicator, and the mirror for the same price that you can usually get one pair of lashes. You guys, this is seriously the lash sale of the year. If you have been wanting to try lashes, stock up on lashes, gift lashes. These make fantastic gifts. Now is the time to do that. So, let me show you, while this is drying, I'm gonna show y'all my favorite kits that are on sale for $39. Obviously, the Sassy Kit I just showed you guys. The Accent Kit. This kit is phenomenal. If you are somebody just looking for a little, little volume on the outer half of your eye. It starts in the middle, goes to the outer corner, gives you a little bit of a cat eye look, but they are very natural while adding a little bit of volume. Now, if you're one of my girls that loves dramatic lashes, maybe you've got parties to go to, events, maybe you're just somebody who likes to wear dramatic lashes on a Tuesday like me, you're gonna wanna grab the Dramatic Kit. Fun fact, this one's only $39, you guys. Only $39 for these lash kits. One set of lashes costs $39. You are seriously getting one pair of lashes, two pairs of lashes for free. One of these for free, one of these for free. It's so insane, you guys. So insane. Two pairs of lashes, a liner, an applicator for free by spending $39 because one pair of lashes is $39. It's insane. The Naughty Kit, one of my favorites. Clearly, this one's missing, it's sitting right over here. I popped it in a spare box. This kit right here, you guys, it is well-loved. I love the Naughty Kit. Once again, three sets of lashes, the applicator, and the liner for only $39. Now, if you're more of a natural girl, this kit's gonna be for you. It's got two accent lashes and then one full lash. So you can really test and try out which is gonna be perfect for you. Love the Natural Kit. It is really, really popular. And then there's the Wifey Kit. This one is one of my all-time favorite kits. The applicator, the liner, three sets of lashes, full-size lashes. You guys, this is", "220a194096c24170b149a26d1db049af.mp4": "Ever feel like a puppy-eyed sea creature after a swim?

She asked me if I heard of Prose. By answering a few questions about my hair, goals, and lifestyle, Prose made custom products just for me. I was sent custom shampoo with hydrolyzed okra extract, which will help reduce my unwanted frizz. Next, we tried my custom curl cream, which is going to give me the perfect level of definition I was looking for. Lastly, we used the custom styling gel and hair oil. My styling gel was customized to the hold level I was looking for. I love the final product. My hair feels softer, and my curls are so much more defined. Thank you, Prose.", "a2e0c95d035024bf3b268bb8938717ee.mp4": "Damn, I'm excited for this event. Affiliate World Europe is the hottest conference for performance marketers this summer.
