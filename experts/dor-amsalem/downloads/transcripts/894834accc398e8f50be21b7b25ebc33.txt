I've been looking for a product like this my whole life. I wear this product every day. We were all putting it on, looking in the mirror, and we're like, oh my God, this is a friggin' miracle. Every morning when I wake up, I put on my dusty rose, I feel this natural glow, and I'm ready for my day. Here's the color breakdown. Au naturel has no color. I use this all the time. It has luminosity just from the moisture content. This is tawny. It really cuts the yellow in my skin. It's got a really nice bronze with just a touch of red in it. This is bronze. This has a little bit of golden to it. Women that have red in their skin, this cuts the redness. Dusty rose, such a beautiful color. It really does enhance a lot of skin tones, makes fair women look like they have the perfect pink blush on, and it makes darker skin women have the perfect little highlight. Sun kissed is the perfect color to add a tint to the skin. They want a little bit of highlight. This also looks incredible on the lips. When you blend it in really good, it gives a really nice tint, but it is the perfect color for darker skin. Flushed is that pop of color that everyone was asking me for. This is such a beautiful pop. It looks good on anyone. Magic hour has become my new go-to. I always have one in my bag. When you really want just some luminosity, you want a little bit of highlight, a little bit of shine, I put this on, and I'm like, okay, I look better. I love that end of the day golden light, especially in the summer. Golden hour makes you look like you're basically on a beach at the end of the day. So I love Miracle Balm. It doesn't require a lot of skill. It doesn't require a lot of time. And honestly, this is the reason I started Jones Road.
