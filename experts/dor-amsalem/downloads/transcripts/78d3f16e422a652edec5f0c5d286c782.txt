I am no longer on Ozempic. I am no longer on high cholesterol medicine. Ever since I started Lumen, I went from probably being the highest weight I ever was to a weight that I was when I was like a teenager. I have yo-yo dieted for 30 plus years. When I started Lumen, I didn't think that I was going to even lose weight because I hadn't. So the fact that I've now lost 50 pounds is pretty incredible. It's just better to know what works for your body, and that's why this device is crucial. You blow into it, and then it tells you what you should be eating. My doctor is actually inspired. She looks at me and she goes, you're no longer in the overweight category. In the six months since I've been using Lumen, I got so many comments. Wow, you look so good. You look so healthy. I just feel more energetic. I feel healthier. I feel more alive. I'm happier. This is my year.
