If you're overweight and unhealthy in America, it's probably not your fault. We're just the product of our environment. We worked with demographers for two and a half years actually to identify pockets around the world where people are living measurably longest. Tools like Lumen gave me insights into, you know, when I should start and stop eating. Better enabled me to eat like somebody in the blue zone. Lumen is a metabolism tracker. It measures the CO2 levels in your breath, indicating if you are burning fats or carbs. It provides guidance and a daily nutrition plan to optimize your metabolism. The intended result we're trying to get is letting our body's natural rhythms take over and tap into our fat stores. Since I started the Lumen, I have been able to really stay in tune with my body. I have noticed a complete change in my body composition. I've been able to reach my best weight and muscle mass yet since high school.
