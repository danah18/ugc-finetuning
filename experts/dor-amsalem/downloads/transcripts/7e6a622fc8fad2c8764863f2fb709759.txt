I wake up, roll over and grab it and do it. First thing in the morning. Every morning. My Lumen is a portable metabolic tracking device. It uses your breath in order to decipher whether you are in fat-burning or carb-burning mode. You inhale, you hold it, release it back and you're done. I have lost 20 pounds. It has helped me lose 35 pounds. Almost 30 pounds. I've gained muscle mass and I've also increased my energy levels. I love it. One day at a time. One breath at a time. Thank you, Lumen.
