Three reasons I regret buying my dot card one. I'm addicted to showing off my dot card when someone asks me for my IG or contact info, I pull this out so fast. Two, I can't stop networking I'm always thinking about scaling my business. Three, I save so much dollar by not buying paper business cards. My friends are always asking me how I built my business and how I've expanding my network and I tell them to get a dot card.
