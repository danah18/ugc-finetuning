Okay, so you know how we're always talking about being stuck in our energy crashes? Well, I found something amazing. This is Lumen. You just breathe into it and it tells me if I'm burning carbs or fats and then it gives me recommendations. It sounds simple, but it's been a total eye-opener for me. I use it to tweak what I eat and when I eat to help stabilize my energy levels. It's like I finally understand my body's language. And it's not about dieting crazily or anything like that. Just more info and data on my body and I'm actually seeing results. I just thought I'd share since we're always swapping tips on here. It's been a real find.
