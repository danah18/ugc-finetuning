What is the last gift you've given that's lasted a lifetime? Gift Hexlad Hybrid Cookware this year, let me explain why. Number one, unmatched searing power. Nonstick on its own doesn't really give you that beautiful sear. Hexlad hybrid design features stainless steel ridges to give you that perfect sear you're craving. Number two, a nonstick surface. Nonstick is easy to clean, the food just slides right off. Number three, unparalleled durability. Hexlad is metal utensil safe, ovens safe up to 500 degrees and dishwasher safe, so you can really put this cookware through the ringer. Number four, a lifetime warranty. Now, replacing crappy pans every few years really does add up, but with Hexlad, you'll buy it once and use it for life. Maybe even hand it down to the kids. Now, how good is that? Really good.
