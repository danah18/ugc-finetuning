Nico will tell you that as a mom, I'm always like, oh, you did a great job. He's like, you're my mom. But I think the City Play gives him the ability to sort of be more targeted in terms of the actual training that he does. You know, for the kids who are really determined to go to the next level, it's super helpful because it just helps them understand what areas they need to improve in. On the thing, I think it's really smart how you can send it to three people. So I send it to my mom, my dad, and then my coach. So they can look at it, they'll get it after practice, and then they can be like, oh, nice job, Nico. We're not in their shoes. We're not on the field like they are. So I think that's the biggest sort of gift for both the player and the parent is that it really does put it in players' hands. We can just kind of relax and enjoy the game.
