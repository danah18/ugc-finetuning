Honestly, wallets kind of suck across the board. I feel like I'm not the only one to say this. MKBHD branded versions of existing Ridge products, which is how we got these, which we got to work on. It's awesome. We have a light mode and a dark mode in there. Super slick. You can do cash strap. You can also attach these or detach them. You could also do an attachment for an AirTag, so just to make sure you don't lose it. Now that it's here, now that it's very much a Ridge wallet but very much an MKBHD creation, I want you to have one. Let me know what you think.
