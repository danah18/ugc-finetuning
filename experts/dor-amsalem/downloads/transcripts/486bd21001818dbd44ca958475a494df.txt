Swimmers hack number six, get rid of chlorine smell. I spend hours in the pool every day, and my hair, well, stinks from chlorine. But now, no more chlorine smell, and no more itchy scalp after swimming. The hair combo includes a 100% natural pre- and post-swim conditioner and post-swim shampoo. I'm telling you guys, this hair combo has been a total game changer for me. You should definitely try it now.
