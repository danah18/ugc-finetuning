I love this question. Check out Lilly. Lilly's a platform that combines banking and bookkeeping in one place. As a small business owner, I'm constantly making purchases or selling products, and Lilly records every transaction so that I don't have to. I love that I can just swipe to categorize my transactions and generate financial reports based on those swipes, which makes things so much easier during tax season. I would definitely recommend it to any small business owner looking to make their lives a little easier.
