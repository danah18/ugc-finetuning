Ring ring. What's that? Someone helped you build a business in 30 days, and it's monetized, and it's absolutely free? Hold on, I gotta tell these guys. So, to commemorate that I just became the largest investor in school, we're running a school game. It's a 30-day challenge to help you build a business or build a community around your existing business. Either work. And I'll walk you through step-by-step how we built our community of Mosey Nation and how you can do the same in that time period. And so if that sounds interesting, besides the fact that it's already free, and the phone call you already got from future you, click the link, join the games, and I'll see you on the other side.
