I love making breakfast, but cleanup with my old pans was a total nightmare. That's why I am totally obsessed with Hexclad. Not only do you get the convenience of non-stick and non-toxic cookware, but you get the searing power and even heat distribution of stainless steel. Plus, they're dishwasher safe, extremely durable, and come with a lifetime warranty. Oh my god, it's just like sliding around everywhere! You want to achieve the perfect sear on your protein? Why not use Hexclad? If it's good enough for Gordon Ramsay, then you know it's legit.
