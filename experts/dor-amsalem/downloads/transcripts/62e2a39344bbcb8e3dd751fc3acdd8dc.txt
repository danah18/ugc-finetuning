My experience with Affiliate World is phenomenal. I've been telling everybody I know that they need to attend events like this a little bit more. Networking here is probably out of this world. It's the best that I've ever had in any other event. Every time I come here, I meet great people. Like, hold on, like this guy here. Check this guy out. Yeah, another great guy. See? This is what networking is all about. This is why I like to come to events like this. I like to hang out with everybody here. The parties are phenomenal, but the networking, my best friends right now are people that I've met at Affiliate World. So this just goes to tell you what it's all about. And if you can make it here, make sure you come say hello. Make sure you come next time. Next one is going to be in Barcelona, and then there's one in Bangkok as well. So make sure you get your ass to either one of those.
