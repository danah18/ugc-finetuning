Local business owners, I have a present. The money for your next 10 locations. If you are a business owner, you're doing a million dollars a year in profit, add a local chain, this is for you. My name is Alex Ramosi, I invest in brick and mortar chains, and right now I'm heavily focusing on health and beauty. And so if you're trying to scale, you usually run into one of three problems. You just don't have the capital, you don't have the people, or you don't have the expertise. At acquisition.com, I spent the last few years building the infrastructure to do just that. Just to give you some context, we open up a new location every seven days, and we manage over a thousand employees across our portfolio. And so I feel really confident in saying that if you want to go from 10 to 50, or from 50 to 500 locations, we can help you do it. And so if that sounds at all interesting to you, click the link, fill out the information, and my team will be in touch with you to see if we can make it rain together.
