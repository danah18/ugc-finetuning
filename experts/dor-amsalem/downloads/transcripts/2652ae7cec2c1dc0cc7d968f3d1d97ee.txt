This is the story about how we went viral on multiple social media platforms at the same time and we were completely sold out of inventory for months. In the summer of 2021, the Fuck Jerry team gave Muddy Bites a shout out on their Instagram page and in short, it broke the internet. It was a total snowball effect and the extra traffic on our Instagram and TikTok caused multiple videos to reach millions of views. All this buzz garnered almost 75 million organic impressions and 10,000 plus overnight orders, causing us to go out of stock. Our co-founders had to call in favors from just about everyone they knew. We rushed in cones, chocolate, and packaging from our suppliers. We had to call in friends and family to help us pack orders. One of our co-founders' grandmas even came in to help. With the support of our investors, suppliers, and customers, we were able to turn it around and come back stronger than ever with a few lessons learned.
