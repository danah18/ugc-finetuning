Hey guys, this was me the last 3-4 years. They're not stretchy, they're not comfortable, look ridiculous on me. So I got rid of them, you should too. Just in, my new bird dog shorts, finally back in stock. These are my Uncle Bucks. Super comfortable, super functional, amazing shorts. They have great pockets, pocket here, pocket here in the back, zip. These are super stretchy. Your khakis at home won't do that. And the best part is the inner liner, which is so incredibly soft, feels like you're wearing a cloud. Super light, super breathable, make your leg look nice and slim, anti-moisture so you can wear it to the gym, quick drying so you can wear it after work. When you're going to lunch by boat, nothing's better. They pretty much do anything you want to do. You can dress them up with a nice little flannel shirt. So when it's 95 degrees and you're going to a country music concert, nothing's better than my new bird dog shorts. And you got your phone right here in your back pocket so you don't lose it. And in the back pocket here you got your beer. You can stretch, step, whatever you gotta do. Get these guys, birddogs.com.
