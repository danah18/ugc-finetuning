I'll never buy Gordon Ramsay's pans again, because it has a lifetime warranty, so I won't need to. I've been using this hex clad pan for over two years. I mean, it looks like it just came out of the box. I've used plenty of metal utensils, and I don't see a single scratch. And the fact that you can put these in the dishwasher has been a lifesaver for me. The beautiful sear and caramelization that I get with these is so much better than any other nonstick I've ever used. So now, I'm down to three pots, three pans, and they're all hex clad. Overall, I am a huge fan. And if you cook as much as I do, they are worth every single penny and then some.
