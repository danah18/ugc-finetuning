Attentions all my fall loving friends, limited edition fall scents just dropped at Grove. Here are the scents that you can get for a limited time to get in the fall mood at home right now. If I could live in a pumpkin spice latte, I would, but in this economy, daily lattes are not in the budget. But Grove Co.'s spiced pumpkin scent smells just as good and lasts even longer in my house than a little drink. Grove Co.'s harvest apple is festive, fruity, and woodsy and just brings back memories of sipping hot apple cider at the orchard with my family. Both of these scents are available in infinitely recyclable dish soap, multi-purpose cleaner concentrate, and a soy wax candle so every room in your home can smell like fall. Our sustainable fall cleaning products and candles are designed to bring the aromas of autumn into your home without harming the planet. So fall in love with the scents of the season at Grove while they last. Which one do you want to try?
