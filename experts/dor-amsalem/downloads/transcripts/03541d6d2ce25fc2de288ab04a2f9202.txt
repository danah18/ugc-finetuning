What I love to do, genuinely makes me happy, is to sit down with my headphones on and just paint. And I just zone out for hours. I can be here for five hours, more than that, and it feels like 30 minutes. And I love it. It is honestly my favourite thing. It's like therapy. It is mentally so good for me.
