So my girlfriend just texted me, "You need to try these new colognes from Dr. Squatch." Why not? So I went online to check them out. There are no harsh ingredients and apparently they're long-lasting and they have manly scents. We'll see about that. So here we have the Fireside Bourbon. Ooh, it's sweet and warm. Yeah, this is some good stuff. This one is Glacial Falls. Oh yeah, this one is cool and refreshing. And last but not least, Woodland Pine. This is definitely the most bold and woodsy of the three, but it's got a really good balance. These are definitely worth every penny.
