If you're struggling with this, then you need to try this. My boyfriend really loves running, but lately he's been struggling with some muscle fatigue that's been a real bummer for him. So I did some research and came across with the Reathlete Air C Heat Compression Leg Massager. And guys, this thing is amazing. He's been using it after his training and it really works on those deep muscles, relaxing the entire leg and alleviating the knee pains. He's back to training harder and feeling better than ever. Plus, I've tried it too and oh my gosh, it feels so good after a long day on your feet. So if any of you are dealing with muscle soreness or just need some good relaxation, you've got to check it out.
