He ate vegetables, stayed active, took all the supplements, but Chris was still getting sick. After spending an entire month and way too much money at a health clinic, Chris discovered the reason he was getting sick was because his body wasn't even absorbing nutrients properly. And that was all thanks to poor gut health. So, working with the best naturopaths, doctors, and medical researchers in the world, Chris created a simple solution.
