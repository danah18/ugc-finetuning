}, Did you know they were doing period all wrong? The painkillers we've been using for the longest time were not designed for our bodies. Most of them were invented in the 1950s and weren't even tested on women in clinical trials. They don't address the root cause of period symptoms, which is usually internal inflammation and hormonal imbalance. I'm so glad I found DeLune, which is a drug-free way to make our periods so much easier. And their Cramp Aid actually addresses the root cause of period pain. I highly recommend checking out DeLune.
