}, I used to use retinol, but when a friend of mine said that they've never touched the stuff, I decided to do some research. Check this out. Retinol is a 9 on their scale that's almost as toxic as it gets. Data from an FDA study indicate that retinoid ingredients may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions on sun-exposed skin. What? Look at this. The known human reproductive toxicant. How about cancer? Oh, one or more animal studies show tumor formation at very low doses? So I swore off using retinol. I found this brand called Bamboo Earth, who claims to have seriously clean skincare. So I looked them up. Okay, here is Bamboo Earth on the EWG. Check that out. All ones. They are so freaking clean. This makeup dirt cleansing oil. Let's scroll down to the ingredient list. Look at that. Five ingredients. And here we have a moisturizer. Ingredient list. Oh, only four ingredients. It just doesn't get any better than that. So I tried out Bamboo Earth and I love it. My skin looks and feels amazing. I love that I'm not putting toxic things on my skin. Consider this my recommendation. Go and check out Bamboo Earth.
