}, What are your top three hair care products? My hair used to look like this, dry, breakable, lifeless. Prep your scalp. A pre-shampoo scalp mask reduces dryness and flaking. This one has argan oil and vitamin B5. Use the right shampoo. Custom hair care saved me. This product was made for my hair type, location, and problems. Aftercare is key. Curl cream is a must to add volume and kill frizz. It's like Photoshop for your hair. How my hair used to look versus now. Thank you, pros.
