}, You're either mine and you're probably wondering how I got them to look this good. When it comes to getting my eyebrows in that perfect shape, I've tried everything. Overpriced salon brow lamination treatments, DIY brow lamination kits that were incomplete and ruined my eyebrows, and brow gels that didn't hold for longer than an hour and gave me white flakes. You name it, I've done it. But that was before I discovered Sassy Saints' DIY Brow Lamination Kit. At first I was quite skeptical about trying another kit, but I quickly realized that they sold out five times already, so it must be worth it. And boy was I right. This is an all-in-one kit that comes with an easy-to-follow, step-by-step video guide so you can get those perfectly shaped brows that last for six whole weeks. Look at how full and fluffy my eyebrows are. Can you believe I made them look this good all by myself? But the best thing about Sassy Saints is that this costs about ten times less than salon treatments and the kits last you around nine months. So it's £8 a treatment compared to £80 in salon treatments. I'd call that a bargain. They have a 40% off promo going on right now, so make sure you grab one before they sell out again.
