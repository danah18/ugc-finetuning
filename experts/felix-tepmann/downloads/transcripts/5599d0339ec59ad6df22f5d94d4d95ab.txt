Stop buying clunky, chunky camera bags. Meet the Runner Backpack, one of our camera bags. There's front access to our removable dividers, letting you customize your setup based on what you're bringing. There's even more space up top for anything else you might need to bring with you. A water-resistant laptop sleeve, and hey, another pocket. An expandable water bottle holder that doubles as a tripod holder. Can't forget about the discreet phone pocket on the back for any safe keeping. There's even a quick side access pocket. Also, for those days you don't need to bring your camera gear, the bag turns into an everyday backpack. Just by removing the dividers, you can fit notebooks, a pair of jeans, and more. So that's why you have to.
