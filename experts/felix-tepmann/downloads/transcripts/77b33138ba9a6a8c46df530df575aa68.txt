Should I be concerned if my dog licks his paws?
Well, this behavior has almost nothing to do with your dog's paws.
You see, this behavior may actually be your pup's way of desperately trying to find comfort from a deeper concern.
A gut microflora imbalance.
You see, just like humans, dogs have bacteria in their gut.
And when a dog's gut isn't firing on all cylinders, it can leave them in a vulnerable state that could compromise their immune and histamine response to allergens.
In simple terms, this means when your dog encounters pollen or allergens in the air,
they will no doubt display behaviors like itching and paw licking.
