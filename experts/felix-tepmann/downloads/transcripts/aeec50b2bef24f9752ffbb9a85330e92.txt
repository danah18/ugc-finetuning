So I keep seeing these ads with Gordon Ramsay, let's see if the hype is real. Apparently the reason why these pans went viral is because they have this hexagon pattern which is stainless steel, so you can get that nice sear on a steak, and it also protects the pan when you're using metal utensils. And then the black part inside of the hexagon is nonstick. You can do cool stuff like this. Okay, so I've had these Hexclad pans for like a couple months now, and I gotta say that I am obsessed. I mean, look at those eggs jiggle. They're also oven safe and dishwasher safe. These things are an easy 10 out of 10. Highly recommend checking out Hexclad.
