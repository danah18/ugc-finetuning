Does eating raw liver and other organs help you pack on insane amounts of ripped muscle? Short answer, heck no. Look, no matter whatever liver royalty says, that ain't going to do much. As a former professional bodybuilder, I know what it takes to pack on insane amounts of muscle. And trust me, it's not eating raw organs. But here's something I do use daily since my days of competitive bodybuilding. Blue Star Nutraceuticals Status Testosterone Booster. I just take three capsules every morning and rest assured knowing my body's natural testosterone production is running at full speed. I'm just as strong as I was back in my competition days. My abs stay shredded. And well, my stamina is good to go. Plus, I feel really healthy and energetic. What I like about Status compared to the rest of the T-Boosters out there is there's no weird chemicals or hormones in it. And because you can see exactly what's in it and also how each ingredient works to help support your natural T-levels. I just really trust it and feel safe using it. Save the raw organs for the other guys and give Status a shot for yourself and see what it's like to have testosterone on your side.
