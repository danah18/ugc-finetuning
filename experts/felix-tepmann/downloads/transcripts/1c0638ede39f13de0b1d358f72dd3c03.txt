Have you heard of the Click Chair? It's all over the internet, so I had to try it. It's a chair the size of a water bottle that weighs less than half of a regular chair, so you could easily take it anywhere with you or easily store it, but it's big enough where I can comfortably sit in it without feeling flimsy. This thing is amazing. It goes from this to this in seconds, and it's so much easier to set up than a regular camping chair. You just undo the straps, snap the legs into place, and literally takes less than 20 seconds. And it's the same thing when you want to put it away. You just fold down the legs, press the button, and it'll fold like an umbrella. I'm absolutely in love with this chair for camping, the beach, hiking, festivals, or anything else outside. Super cool and worth the splurge if you use a camping chair a lot.
