Moon, electric toothbrush and whitening oral care bundle, I cannot believe how white my teeth are. This has literally changed my oral routine. I bought the Sonic Smile Bundle. It lives up to the hype. The Moon electric toothbrush is all you need. It comes with five smart modes. Clean, white, polish, massage, and sensitive. There are up to 36,000 sonic vibrations per minute in this bad boy. Which is 120 times more powerful than a manual toothbrush. This contains elixir actives which has antioxidants and essential oils. And then it has this really cool whitening booster. Moon Dust uses kaolin and bentonite clay to help blast away those annoying stains. Moon, check it out.
