Kitsch, satin pillowcases that reduce hair frizz and skin irritation, help preserve skincare products, regulate temperature, and provide an affordable alternative to silk pillowcases., So this made my friends think that I got Botox. If you're thinking about getting Botox, stop and get this instead. A few months back I saw an ad on TikTok that told me my cotton pillowcases are literally aging me overnight. Then I found these Kitsch satin pillowcases that changed my life. Satin prevents agitation of your hair and skin while you sleep, allowing me to wake up frizz-free and fresh-faced, and it ensures skincare products are not absorbed into your pillowcase like cotton. Satin regulates temperatures, so it keeps me really dry and comfy all night. They're also so affordable, they're only a fraction of the price of silk pillowcases. Do not wait and save your money on Botox. Get the Kitsch satin pillowcase ASAP.
