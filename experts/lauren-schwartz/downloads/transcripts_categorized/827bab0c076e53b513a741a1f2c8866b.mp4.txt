Codex, skincare bundle for dry, sensitive, and eczema-prone skin (includes gentle soap, nourishing facial oil, and superfood moisturizer), If you have eczema-prone skin, you need this. I struggle so much finding skincare products that don't irritate my skin or cause flakiness. Until I found Codex Dry Sensitive Skin Set. My latest order just got here. They ship right to your door. Let me show you what I got. The bundle comes with the Baya Unscented Soap, Baya Nourishing Facial Oil, and the Baya Skin Superfood. The soap is super gentle, and I can use it on my face and body. My skin doesn't feel dried out after washing, and it keeps my microbiome safe, so I don't get infections. The Superfood lives up to the name, I can tell you that. You can use it on your face, hands, and anywhere on your body. It soothes instantly and keeps your skin hydrated without making you feel oily. The oil is not greasy at all, and it leaves my skin so moisturized and soft. Happy to be rid of flaky patches. I'll be using this forever. I'd never go back.
