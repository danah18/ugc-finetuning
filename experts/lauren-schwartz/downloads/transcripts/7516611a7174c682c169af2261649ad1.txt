If there's one skincare ingredient that helped clear up my skin, it's tretinoin. I've struggled with acne my entire life, from breakouts to bumpy skin. You name it, I've had it. But once I started incorporating tretinoin into my skincare routine, I saw a huge difference in the overall texture of my skin. But what no one tells you is that you actually need a prescription to get tretinoin. And that's why I started using Curology. Their custom skincare has ingredients like tretinoin to help target your specific skin needs. Just go online and take their quiz, then their dermatology providers will send you a cleanser, a custom formula, and a moisturizer. Plus, it's delivered straight to your door so there's no appointment or prescription necessary. Seriously, start incorporating ingredients like tretinoin into your skincare routine with Curology.
