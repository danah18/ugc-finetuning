This is going to save you so much time and money. This one jar is 30 full manicures, and that's so much money saved. Guys, I am obsessed with Nail Boo, and I'm about to tell you why. Imagine never having to go to the nail salon ever again. Wouldn't that just be great? Because, yeah. Nail Boo gives you salon-quality nails right from home, and the process is so easy. All you have to do is coat, dip, and activate. That's all you have to do. It literally only took me five minutes. This kit comes with everything that you will need, so you can be able to do it at home by yourself, and my nails have lasted weeks with Nail Boo, and it can even help strengthen and improve your nails, and my nails are so strong. You have so many colors to choose from, and I love all the neon colors. They're amazing. It's super easy to remove if you want to try a different color, and you can also use it on your toes for a pedicure. And let me tell you, it's way better than nail polish.
