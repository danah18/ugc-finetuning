It doesn't taste like super artificial like most of the seltzers. June Shine. It's like super fresh. This reminds me of summer for sure. I was expecting like a sharper taste but it's nice and smooth. Probably crush these all day long. Scream summer. It's like partying in your mouth. Definitely a lot different than the seltzer. It doesn't taste like super artificial like most of the seltzers. There's literally only four ingredients. Grapefruit, lime, green tea, and juice kombucha. Six percent? That's pretty good because you can't even taste it. Six percent. This one is a hoppy cool citrus. That's really cute. Hoppy cool citrus. Wow. Sometimes you have a hoppy IPA, you only want one. I could crush about six of these. We don't even talk about beer anymore. We don't know more. I could see myself pre-gaming with this with the fellas. Like ice cold when you're at the beach. Poolside on a Saturday. I would have it for breakfast. I know you're not supposed to do that but it's kombucha so I feel like it's okay. Cheers guys.
