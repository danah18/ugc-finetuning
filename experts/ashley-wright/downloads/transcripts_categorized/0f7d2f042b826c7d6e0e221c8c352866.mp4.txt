}, Products I'm done gatekeeping part two. This is my secret weapon when it comes to dealing with dark circles and puffy eyes. I often have long days and short nights, leaving my under eyes looking puffy and tired. Eyes are the first things that people see and dark circles are the last thing I want others to notice. So one day I was browsing through Instagram and saw Jessica Alba using the Grace and Stella Energy Drink Eye Mask. After seeing they were featured in BoxyCharm and had over 2,000 five-star reviews, I was hooked. So long story short, I had to try them. After only one use, I started noticing less puffy, brighter under eyes. And after a month, my dark circles were lighter, my skin was softer, and I looked way less tired. The reason why is because Grace and Stella packed these with powerful yet gentle ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid, collagen, and chondrus chrysus powder, which are all amazing ingredients to help hydrate and plump the skin. They completely brighten my complexion and make me feel so much more confident. Plus, they're vegan, cruelty-free, and they make me feel like I'm at the spa. I use them every morning before I put on my makeup, and I keep them in the fridge so they're nice and cold when I apply them under my eyes. If you want to get rid of dark circles and reduce under-eye puffiness, you need to try the Grace and Stella Under-Eye Masks.
