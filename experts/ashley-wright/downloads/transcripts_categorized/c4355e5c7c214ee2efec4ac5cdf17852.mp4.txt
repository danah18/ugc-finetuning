}, Why is nobody talking about fermented skincare? This serum is made by Fervor, and all you have to do is shake to activate. This serum has no synthetic colors or fragrance. I only need to use two to three drops and gently massage into my clean skin. I use this serum every day under my moisturizer. It's so lightweight that I don't have to worry about layering it with the rest of my skincare routine. If you want to see the difference in fermented skincare, you need to try Fervor.
