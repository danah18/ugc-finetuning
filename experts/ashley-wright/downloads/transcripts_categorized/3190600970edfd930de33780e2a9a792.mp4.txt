}, Here's the hack of how I get my beard from this to this. I use a five-step routine from Scotch Porter. Now I start off with a beard wash. It helps invigorate me and just wash away all the grime of the day. The next step is a beard conditioner, and this again washes in, washes out. Next up is a beard balm. There's even a leave-in conditioner on the days when I need a little more. Next up is a beard serum. This I work in, and my beard looks amazing.
