}, Guys, I'm officially breaking up with Sephora. I got the best full-size care products, all worth up to $300, and I only paid $47.99. I got this Summer Fridays moisturizer. I've been dying to try this brand since I've seen them all over my For You page. This Tula C vitamin serum is everything. If you know, you know. She is glowing. Too Faced is my holy grail. I'm obsessed with this liner. You can get six to eight full-size products up to a $300 value just for $47.99. Run to FabFitFun.com and you can thank me later.
