}, Stop scrolling if you want to learn how to cook on a budget. Big grocery stores often reject food for their little imperfections, meaning a ton of food goes to waste every day for being a little different. But by shopping at Imperfect Foods, you can stop food waste and still get the same quality and fresh ingredients as big grocery stores at a more affordable price. Take a look at these items. Everything I received in this box still had the same quality. I love how they bubble wrapped a carton of eggs too. I also made a mahi-mahi with green beans for under $20 and so can you. They even have weekly deals so you can save money. Imperfect Foods is so convenient since you can pick and choose what items you want every week and have it delivered straight to your door.
