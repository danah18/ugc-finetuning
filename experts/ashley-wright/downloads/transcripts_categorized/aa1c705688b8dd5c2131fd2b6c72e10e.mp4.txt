}, I was reading this InStyle article that mentions Quince's cotton fisherman crew neck sweater, and as soon as I clicked the link, I knew I needed to try it. Okay, I really like this. This is such a high-quality sweater, I don't even know what to say. What's insane is this sweater is only $40, but I know Jenny Kane sells a similar one that goes for over $300 more. I was going to gatekeep this brand, but I think it's so incredible. I think everyone needs to be shopping for this.
