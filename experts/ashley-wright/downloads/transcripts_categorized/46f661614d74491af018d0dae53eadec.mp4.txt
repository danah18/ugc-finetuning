}, Okay, so I saw this on TikTok and now I am obsessed. I felt like I never had enough time to make a filling breakfast without cooking a whole big meal and leaving a mess. I was about to just give up on breakfast forever. This is Magic Spoon. I kept seeing it all over my TikTok and the reviews are incredible. Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar, 14 grams of protein, 4 grams of net carbs, 140 calories a bowl, and most importantly, delicious. These aren't the sugary high fructose carb bombs that lead to mid-morning crashes. They're high protein, keto-friendly, gluten-free, grain-free, soy-free, wheat-free. My favorite way to have it is with cold, unsweetened almond milk. Keeping me on that keto journey. This cereal is a total game-changer and it has more protein than two eggs. If you want to start the day with cereal and stay full till lunch, this is your holy grail.
