So I saw this article in InStyle about a brand called Quince. The co-founder says it's Quince's mission to put quality essentials into the reach of more people by selling luxury products that are both affordable and earth-friendly. As you guys know, I'm always trying to create an elevated and sustainable closet with staple basics that I can wear over and over again. But the pieces I'm looking for are often way out of my budget. So I started shopping at Quince and the amount of money I saved is crazy. For example, this cotton fisherman sweater is under $40, but it's the same one Jenny Kane sells for $345. Or this 100% silk slip dress for under $80, which normally I would pay two to three times more for other brands. Shipping is always free and they offer 365 days to return, which is also free. Plus you get these great prices with no strings attached, no membership or subscription fees. Now I have the closet of my dreams without breaking the bank thanks to Quince. Tap the link below and check them out for yourself. I promise you'll thank me later.
