This tinted moisturizer went viral on TikTok. The Glow Me tinted moisturizer is perfect for everyday wear and it works with any skin tone. It's hydrating, has SPF 30, and also has this nice light tint. I love how it's both makeup and skincare in one product. Guys, my skin feels so nice and firm after using this. I love that I can wear this even when I'm outside or working out and it'll still stay on my skin. This is the best tinted moisturizer I've tried.
