Meet my new go-to bag for any occasion. This is the Pebble Grain Large Tote from Dooney & Burke, and it's the best wardrobe staple I've gotten in a long time. It's made from rich European leather with 14-karat gold hardware that is handcrafted in Italy. I love the size of this bag because it's big enough to fit everything I need to bring with me. I can put my laptop, phone, chargers, makeup bag, and everything else I need inside without worries. It can handle the load and doesn't feel too heavy. I can pair this with any outfit or look because of its versatile, timeless look, whether I'm wearing a messy bun or all dressed up for a fancy dinner. It comes in 20 different colors for you to choose from, so there's always one to fit your style best. I'm obsessed with this. It's definitely become part of my daily routine.
