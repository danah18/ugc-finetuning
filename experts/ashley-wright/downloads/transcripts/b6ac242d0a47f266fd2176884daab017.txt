What I ordered versus what I got for my husband from Built. My husband loves Built Basics and I spoiled him. I got him some really good stuff, so tell me what you think about it. Built really has everything your man could ever need. They're elevated everyday basics that can be dressed up or down, and he'll actually want to wear them over and over. They won't break the bank compared to luxury labels, but the pieces are quality and made to last, unlike the cheap fast fashion alternatives. You could easily build him a foolproof capsule wardrobe for work, going out, lounging, working out, you name it. If you want to step up your man's style game, start with Built. Shop tees, pants, jackets, and more at builtbasics.com.
