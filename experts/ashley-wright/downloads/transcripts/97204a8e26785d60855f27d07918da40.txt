One of the things that I'm really passionate about as an OBGYN and as a physician is advocating and empowering women to learn more about their bodies and their fertility because I think it's just too important of a topic for us as women to leave to chance and to cross our fingers and hope that when the time comes we'll be okay. And so if you do go to a doctor and you're like, I want to learn more about your fertility and their responses, oh, you're young, don't worry about it. Like, don't take that no for an answer.
