Meet Greg and Gabby. They wanted a delicious and healthy cereal. So, they started Magic Spoon. Remember the feeling of munching on sugary cereal while watching Saturday morning cartoons? Well, Magic Spoon infused all that nostalgia into every magical bite. We experimented until we got the recipe perfect. With zero grams of sugar, 12 to 14 grams of protein, and 4 grams of net carbs, it's safe to say we started a cereal revolution. Get the fuel of a full breakfast from a sweet and delicious bowl of cereal.
