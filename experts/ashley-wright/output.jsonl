Their featured products include the Boomstick Trio\u2014three multipurpose sticks called Boom Glow (a moisturizer)"}]}, "preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Some of us of a certain age are happy to announce that a revolution has arrived. Nothing covers up what you've got because this former makeup artist turned model and entrepreneur isn't about hiding your age, but embracing it. Many years ago, I noticed this beautiful silver haired model on the internet and in magazines, and of course that was Cindy Joseph of Boom. I was like, yes, this is it. There aren't a lot of examples of honest, joyful aging out there. She looked like an older woman who was having a marvelous time being an older woman, and I was absolutely mesmerized. Every single cosmetic company offers anti-aging products, anti-wrinkle cream, anti-me, anti-all of my peers. So I thought, it's time to create something that's pro-age. One of the products that are so fantastic are her Boom Trio. These three little sticks are game changers. I am crazy about this. You are not going to believe this. It's so amazing. Three incredible boom sticks. Glow, glimmer, and color. The first stick that I wear is Boom Glow. It's a moisturizer that you can just use all day long if you like, lips, mouth, eyes, just a little bit of freshening. Made from honey, from beeswax, from olive oil. I glided on all over my face, just massage it in, and it's just beautiful. The neat thing about the Boom cosmetics is that they moisturize. Now it's time for my favorite, Boom Color. I don't know how you guys do it at Boom by Cindy Joseph, but this color looks fantastic on everybody. One of the amazing things about this product is that it adapts to every skin tone. It's so sheer, you don't even know where that magic is coming from. I'm going to put it anywhere I want a little contouring or a little glow. I tend to dot. I dot the color stick. Can you see that lovely blush look? I'm telling you, in the beginning it will look like it's too much, but it's magical. After a few minutes, this just really looks like I'm blushing. And it's the perfect lipstick. Like I said, the perfect color. I don't go anywhere without it. It's so moisturizing. And then the Boomstick Glimmer is so fun. This is a golden, glimmery, shimmery stick of lusciousness. You put it anywhere where you want to just express more. So I love this because it gives you just enough of that little iridescence. You just put it anywhere you want a little extra glow or a little extra glimmer. Watch. It just adds a little highlight, makes you look like you got kissed by the sun. Fantastic place, right there on your lips. Look at that. Isn't that beautiful? I love it. As you can see, it takes minutes. Not a big deal. I feel like I look fresh, but I have some color, and I just love these products. But I have one more surprise, and that's called Boom Bright Mascara for Women Over 50. This is a hydrating mascara that's designed to separate the lashes. The color is a soft black. This is a universal color that we can all wear. It really makes my eyes pop. It feels wonderful. You can layer this if you're going out at night. You might want to put a couple layers on. And it does not clump, which is huge. And it doesn't wear off or fall off. And it's just the right coverage. How natural is that? I love it. So just like that, in three sticks, that's the Boom Beauty Glow, and that's how easy it is. That's how I boom. Using Boom makes me feel radiant and confident and happy. It helps me to feel as beautiful on the outside as I do on the inside. They are so simple, and I can bring a healthy glow to my face, but I'm only trying to enhance what's already there, and I am free to be me. When a woman feels good about herself, she looks good. We could just be ourselves and be totally gloriously attractive and beautiful and radiant. Keep that spark of life and that enthusiasm. That looks good. It could be silver, it could be wrinkled, but it looks good. It looks exciting. It's the last piece. Women have gone through their many revolutions throughout history, and now it's time to drop this last judgment, this last negative judgment we have about ourselves, that somehow, after 30, things go downhill. And I can assure you, they go uphill. Enjoy it all."}], "non_preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Experience the beauty of aging with Boom by Cindy Joseph.

This is my secret weapon when it comes to dealing with dark circles and puffy eyes. I often have long days and short nights, leaving my under eyes looking puffy and tired. Eyes are the first things that people see and dark circles are the last thing I want others to notice. So one day I was browsing through Instagram and saw Jessica Alba using the Grace and Stella Energy Drink Eye Mask. After seeing they were featured in BoxyCharm and had over 2,000 five-star reviews, I was hooked. So long story short, I had to try them. After only one use, I started noticing less puffy, brighter under eyes. And after a month, my dark circles were lighter, my skin was softer, and I looked way less tired. The reason why is because Grace and Stella packed these with powerful yet gentle ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid, collagen, and chondrus chrysus powder, which are all amazing ingredients to help hydrate and plump the skin. They completely brighten my complexion and make me feel so much more confident. Plus, they're vegan, cruelty-free, and they make me feel like I'm at the spa. I use them every morning before I put on my makeup, and I keep them in the fridge so they're nice and cold when I apply them under my eyes.
