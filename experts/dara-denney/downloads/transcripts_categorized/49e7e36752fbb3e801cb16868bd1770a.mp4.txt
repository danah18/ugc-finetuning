}, I have tried every single lip plumper on the planet and none of them worked for me until I found this. So this is the lip plumping oil by Kosas. I'm telling you, it's light and it's amazing. I did not expect a lip oil to actually plump. I have it on right now. I swear to God, I have the smallest lips in the world. The moment I put this, it doesn't sting, it's not sticky, it's literally so natural and like it plumps. And this is how my lips look with it.
