}, Let's make it okay to talk about period symptoms. My name is Mimi, I'm founder of Delune, and I'm here to tell you that hiding your period symptoms is canceled. We are talking about them. Especially at work, make your menstrual phase your slack status, I dare you. Over 70% of people with PMS report that it affects their ability to do their job, so this is totally valid to share with your teammates. I mean, think about it, half of us are just walking around cramping, bloating, tired, PMSing, and we're just supposed to keep that to ourselves? No, no, no, no, I don't think so. Until we have menstrual leave, hygiene products, and relief products in every place, we're gonna make this everyone's problem, okay? Tell your boss the truth about why you're taking the afternoon off. If it makes them uncomfortable, that's their problem. Period cramps are the leading cause of absenteeism from work in women under 30, and it's time to get real about that. And if you get period cramps or PMS, you know what to do. Try Delune and follow us for more period-positive content.
