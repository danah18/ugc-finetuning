}, I went to hot yoga this morning with eyebrow gel in and the instructor was like, do you have a brow lamination? And I was like, no girl, I just have a really good eyebrow gel, which is this. This has been my holy grail for so long. This is the Kosas Airbrow in Clear. They also have the brow pop pencils. I'm just going to do one so you can see the difference that it makes in my face. I'm using medium brow. It's really small brow like strokes. I'm going to use the clear brow gel. There is one brow done. Like, I just feel like it makes my face look so much more lifted. I literally recommend all of these products to everybody because they slay. They slay and they stay all day. Bye.
