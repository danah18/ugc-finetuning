We get this comment a lot asking why we're so expensive. People think they can make this at home for less, so we broke the math down for you. The base of most of our recipes consists of oats, chia seeds, flax seed, maple syrup, whey protein, and monk fruit. This is the price of each of those ingredients if you were to get them in the store, meaning you would at least be spending $60. But let's look at the servings. This is the cost of each ingredient if you were to break it down by serving, which leaves you with a base cost of $2.48. But keep in mind, this is without any flavorings or fruit. Let's say you wanted to add a banana. $3.15 for a meal that still isn't going to taste great. But what if you use oats overnight? You're saving money and time because you don't have to shop, there's no prep time, and we have over 30 amazing flavors like chocolate chip cookie dough, s'mores, and fruity cereal, all for as low as $2.63 per meal. It's common sense. Save time, save money, and use oats overnight.
