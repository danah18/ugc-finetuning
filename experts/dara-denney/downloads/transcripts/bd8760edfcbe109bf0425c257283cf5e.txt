I went to 10 dermatologists and all they could suggest for me was birth control. Hi, I'm Greer, I'm the founder of FLO. I struggled so badly with hormonal acne every single time my period would come around. I tried everything, I went to doctors, I was on multiple acne medications. I feelage Sephora, my student had acne, it was not a skin condition but a hormonal issue. And the only solution for that was birth control. And one night I created FLO, the first ever PMS vitamin that encompassed all of these natural gluten-free vegan ingredients that actually work to balance your hormones and solve the problem from the source.
