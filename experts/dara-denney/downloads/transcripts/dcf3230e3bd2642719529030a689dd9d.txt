I bled through my wedding dress, so two of my bridesmaids were literally dabbing blood off the back of my butt. It was truly awful, and I wish Elix existed to help minimize these period surprises.

I started Elix because I never knew I could feel this good when I'm on my period. So if you feel like you've tried everything out there, give Elix a try because it actually works with your body to lower inflammation, balance your hormones, and heal from within.
