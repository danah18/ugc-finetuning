I have the secret to the best eyelashes you will ever have. The liquid lash extensions mascara will seriously change your makeup game even just with one coat. The difference is insane. It literally looks like I have extensions. It's crazy. I can't even, they almost touch my eyebrows. I have to be really careful. It doesn't make your eyelashes clumpy. It's so easy to do, so easy to take off. It's the only mascara I use. It's amazing.
