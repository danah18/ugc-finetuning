When I was younger, I had the worst period cramps. Like they were so painful I would have to miss school, I would have to miss work. So I started taking painkillers, but they turned out to be not so good for me. I ended up with really bad side effects and I had to find a better alternative. I teamed up with my friend Courtney, who's a dietitian, and we created this beautiful little miracle called Cramp Aid. It is packed with natural anti-inflammatories, antispasmodics, so you can get fast relief while also supporting your menstrual health. We built a whole brand called The Loon, and we are focused on menstrual wellness. We've already helped thousands of people have healthy, easy periods. And I mean, just look at this. So if you're someone like my younger self who's out there struggling, I know how hard it is and I'm here for you. Try The Loon, reach out to me, let me know how it's going.
