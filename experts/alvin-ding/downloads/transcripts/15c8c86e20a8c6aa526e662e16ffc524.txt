Writing freely is an adventure. One of the things I love about Remarkable is that I can go wherever I need to. Our minds operate in different ways in different contexts. Sometimes I just need a different environment and to be able to fluidly move from the work that I was doing in the office to another location is something that I really value. It relaxes me. It takes me into a whole different headspace. It doesn't feel so much like work.
