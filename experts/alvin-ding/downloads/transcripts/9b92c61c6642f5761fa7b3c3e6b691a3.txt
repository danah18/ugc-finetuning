What's one thing nobody tells you about being a parent? That your kids are going to waste so much food. And that your trash is going to smell like a wet sock. That was until I discovered this genius invention. Meet Lomi. This thing turns food scraps into nutrient-rich dirt in less than four hours. Chicken nuggets, scrambled eggs, pretty much everything. Just drop in a Lomi tablet with a little bit of water, close the smell-proof lid, and boom. It's odor-free, mess-free, and it's super quiet. Plus, it's good for the environment.
