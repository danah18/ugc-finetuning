Ever worry about your kids getting into the cleaning cabinet? You need to see this. Meet Biome. Crafted from 100% plant-based materials, without a trace of plastic or toxic chemicals. Engineered to tackle tough messes while being gentle on your skin, pets, and little ones. With natural scents like lavender and grapefruit, they transform cleaning into a sensory experience. Most wipes contribute to landfill waste, but not Biome. Our wipes are fully biodegradable and home compostable. And the refillable dispensers aren't just functional, they come in an array of colors so you can proudly leave them on display, right where you need them.
