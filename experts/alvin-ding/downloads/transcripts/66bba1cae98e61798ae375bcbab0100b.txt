The amount of food I throw away as a parent is insane. Wait, wait, wait, wait, I got you. I am obsessed with this new invention. Meet Lomi. This thing turns food scraps into nutrient-rich dirt in less than four hours. Genius, I know. Chicken nuggets, scrambled eggs, pretty much everything. Just drop in a Lomi tablet with a little bit of water, close the smell-proof lid, and boom. It's odor-free, mess-free, and it's super quiet. Plus, it's good for the environment.
