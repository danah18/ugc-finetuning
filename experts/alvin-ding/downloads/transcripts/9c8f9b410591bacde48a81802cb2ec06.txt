Like it or not, there's gonna come a day when you think, we should do a podcast. I should start a YouTube channel. I should record my screen. Oh my God, we record a lot of stuff. Yep, you do. Meet Descript. It's a powerful new tool that makes editing easy. So easy that you'll want to edit videos. Nice. How does it work? Well, first you need some video or audio. Just drag it right into Descript. Wait for it. Hey guys, welcome to my first YouTube video. Whoa. What? No. Yeah. It takes your audio and turns it into text. So when this happens. All right guys, I'm going in. What? Dinner. I'm doing a thing, mom! You can cut it out like this. Okay. With support for things like non-destructive multi-track precision editing, titles, transitions, and keyframe animation, even exporting your project to other pro apps. No! So when you capture media, hey guys, make sure you edit it in Descript. Descript.
