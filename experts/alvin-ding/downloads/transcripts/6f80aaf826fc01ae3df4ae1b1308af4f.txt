I had a personal trainer that I worked out with for three months and I only lost four pounds. I've been doing Noom and I've already lost 20 pounds. Despite how much I worked out, my weight just didn't change. Then I tried Noom and I lost 10 pounds. I lost 14 pounds. I've lost 10 pounds. 9 pounds lighter and a lot happier.
