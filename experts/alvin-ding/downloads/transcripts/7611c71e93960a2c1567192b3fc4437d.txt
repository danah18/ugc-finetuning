I'm Stephanie Dunson, I'm a writing specialist and Remarkable user. I use Remarkable in just about every facet of the work that I do. The thing that attracted me to Remarkable to begin with is the idea of having a tactile relationship with writing. And that's one of the things that I really love about it, is that feel, that texture, that it actually feels like you're writing on paper.
