Five things I put in my Lomi that I would never put in my backyard compost: eggshells, citrus peels and rind, dinner leftovers, fish and dairy. When I can compost all of our food waste with Lomi, I use our backyard compost mostly just for yard debris. Lomi is a controlled composting environment. I don't have to worry about bugs, smells, or any substances that might be harmful to my plants because there's no risk of excess humidity or high acidity. Lomi is the number one hack for composting all year long. Visit lomi.com.
