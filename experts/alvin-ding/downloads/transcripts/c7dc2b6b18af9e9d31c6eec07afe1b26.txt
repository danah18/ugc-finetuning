We've been traveling in our RV for over three years and we visited 48 out of the 50 US states and we've used Progressive for our RV insurance the entire time. We've actually partnered with Progressive to share some of the reasons why. Progressive has had insurance policies for all of the campers we've had and we typically use their short, hassle-free in-app quote process to insure our campers and it's so stress-free and easy. Another great thing about Progressive is that they have great claim service so in the case of an accident, Progressive has always had our back. We absolutely love our Progressive RV insurance and if you're looking for insurance that actually covers you, make sure to head over to progressive.com forward slash RV for more information and to see what options they may have available for you.
