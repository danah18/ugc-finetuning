So I have these really stubborn marks on my face. I'm gonna try the Caudalie Vino Perfect Serum to see if it can help. This is gonna be day one of me trying this serum. This was after the first use of the serum. As time went on, I saw so much improvement in my skin texture and hyperpigmentation. It's supposed to be 62 times more effective than vitamin C when it comes to brightening skin. I am halfway through the bottle now. My skin is looking amazing. It's feeling good. Lots of bumps have flattened down. Hyperpigmentation is disappearing. I'm loving what's happening here.
