Why do I love my Remarkable? It gives off this vibe of notebook meets tablet, but like a perfect blend of having technology but not having too much technology. My name is Jossie Calhoun. I am a front-end software engineer, content creator, and Remarkable user. A typical day for me is pretty hectic. Using the Remarkable in the morning allows me to be more proactive. I am juggling so many things, being an engineer, writing code, supporting customers. Maybe I'm designing something for a website. Remarkable plays a major role in my day-to-day because it keeps me organized. I can easily find notes and documents that I'm looking for. Having this digital device that gives me this tactile, pen-to-paper type of experience, it keeps me more accountable and aware of my goals. And then I like to use the Remarkable for maybe some more inspirational or creative work, thinking of a cool video idea I want to do. With Remarkable, I have a notebook for more free thought. You can do things on the Remarkable that you simply can't do with paper. I couldn't be happier with it.
