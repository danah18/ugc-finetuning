Today I'm trying Descript as part of my Innovate series where I try digital innovations meant to make our lives easier. Apparently you can edit your audio and video content like it's a Word doc? We'll see. If you ever want to create video content, the rough cut is the most brutal part for me. That's when you go through all of your film to pick out the gold. Supposedly, I can upload my film to Descript and it creates a transcript of the entire video. Let's see. Oh, okay, it did do that. Now for example, these two sentences, I don't care for that first point, so I guess just delete the sentence. But did do the job. Play. Could come off a little conspiracy theorist, but I'm willing to take the hit. Oh wow. What if I did like a single word? Could come off conspiracy theorist, but I'm willing to take the hit. I mean, that's seamless. There's no dead air time and it's exactly how I would edit it on my own. I don't like you today. Click. Play. I don't like you today. I mean, anyone who edits videos or podcasts knows that this is epic.
