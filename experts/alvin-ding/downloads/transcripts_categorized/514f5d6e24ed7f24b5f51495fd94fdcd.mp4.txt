}, Here's how I did this simple head-tracking dance video effect. First, I recorded myself in 4K doing a little dancey dance. Next, we'll open up Adobe After Effects and start a new project. Drag the footage into the project and make a new composition. I tweaked the aspect ratio for vertical video. Let's throw the video into the comp, then pop over to the tracker window and hit stabilize motion. I put the track point on my eye, but anything contrasty on faces should work. Position your boxes and click the forward button to watch as After Effects tracks that bad boy like magic. Whenever a track goes off course, do a little readjust, and you're back on track. Once I'm happy with all my points, I'll apply them and hit OK. I'll finish it off by repositioning myself as the center of the frame, and just like that, we're done. Very swag and very cool.
