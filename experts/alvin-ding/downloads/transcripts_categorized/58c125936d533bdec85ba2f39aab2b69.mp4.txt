}, Holding a knife is like driving in a car. You've got to feel so comfortable in that wheel, but more importantly, you have to relax your hands. It's all about the handle. When I feel comfortable with the grip, then I've got so much more precision. Thumb on the side, index finger underneath, tuck those fingers in, and just get used to that position. The opposite hand, fingers one in front, two behind. You never slice with your fingers exposed. You never chop with your fingers out. It's always three fingers down, and this beautiful knuckle is the guiding light across that knife. That's your protector. Chopping is not about learning to chop fast. It's chopping with accuracy and understanding that every slice is pivotal, every movement is crucial, but you need to be comfortable. Once you're comfortable with the motion of where you're going, you can literally close your eyes and feel the knife every slice. The more precise you are, the quicker and the better you chop.
