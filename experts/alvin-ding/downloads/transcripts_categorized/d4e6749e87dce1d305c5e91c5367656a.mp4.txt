}, I'm going to show you my favorite products from Kosas. Revealer Skin Improving Foundation. It feels so weightless. This is no filter and you can see it just doesn't sink into anything or cling on to any of my dry patches. This is the Revealer Concealer. If I want to bake one day with powder, this doesn't make it look dry. I just feel like this is a great everyday concealer. Blend it out. And this is up close. Kosas Cloud Set Powder. And this is like the ultimate powder to use if you don't want to look cakey. Up close. Look at that. This is the Kosas Gloss in the shade Unbuttoned. It's so pretty. My holy grails from Kosas. I absolutely love these products. So yeah. What do we think?
