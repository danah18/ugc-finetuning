}, After living in an RV for three years, we are buying a house and we will be traveling part-time in a smaller RV. We have partnered with Progressive to answer some of the questions you guys asked us a few weeks ago about our RV insurance with Progressive. Regular RV coverage is for people with a primary residence and uses their camper for camping or vacations. Full-timers insurance covers when you are living in your RV full-time. Rates depend on several factors including make, model, and year of your RV or motorhome. Our experience with Progressive has been amazing and it is really easy to get an online quote and see how much money you could be saving and their excellent coverage options.
