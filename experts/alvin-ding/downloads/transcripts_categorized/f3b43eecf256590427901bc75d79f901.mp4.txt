}, This is one of my favorite apps. So if you're a student like me, you know the struggle of having to rush assignments at the last minute. Download the Grammarly app which is your own digital writing assistant. Once it's set up, whenever you type anything, it'll scan what you wrote and will help you choose better words. The free version has basic spelling and grammar suggestions, but premium will help you with verb tenses, vocabulary suggestions, and more. This is great for quickly checking my work when it's 11:59 and I have an assignment due at 12. Share this with all of your friends and download it on the App Store and Play Store.
