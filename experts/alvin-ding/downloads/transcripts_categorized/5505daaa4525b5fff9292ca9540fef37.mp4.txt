}, I'm the sort of person who really loves the feeling of the pen on the page, that feel, that texture. Times when I have to write on a computer, there's something that feels very distant about it. You can have all of the tactile experience of writing, the feeling of the pen on the page, the sound, but then you have the modern convenience of having it immediately transcribed into digital form.
