}, I love the C Beyond Triple SPF Serum. I put it on before all of my makeup. It's a nice tint, there's no white cast, so it leaves my skin with a nice subtle glow. It also lays under my makeup so well, and most importantly, I love that I'm being protected from the sun with the SPF 40. It's definitely my new favorite product.
