}, I used to have to take my garbage out every couple of days. Now it feels like I only have to do it once a week. I like to cook plant-based, and the Lomi makes it so much easier. How does Lomi work? I just take all of my food scraps and I chop them up pretty finely. And then I put them into the bin. As soon as that's full, I then turn on my Lomi, just like you turn on a dishwasher, literally just pushing a button. A few hours later, it's a fresh, nutritious dirt that I can use for my plants. No more messy, stinky garbage. Lomi not only looks good on my counter, but it seals in any of those unpleasant smells that may come from rotting food. It's time to switch to kitchen convenience in 2023 by visiting Lomi.com.
