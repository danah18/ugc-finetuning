Talented staff have a choice where to work, and a lot of them will choose to work somewhere with good tips. So what if I told you you could have bigger check sizes, faster turnovers, and servers could earn 25% more in tips? Are you ready for the catch? It's ready. Ready is a digital menu and ordering software that is just that. It's ready to go. Customers can view a menu and order just by scanning a QR code. This makes customers happy, and happy customers make for happy staff. Digital menus are an absolute must for any restaurant not stuck in the dark ages. But nobody wants a glitchy app or some crazy proprietary hardware. You just want it to be ready. There's currently a 14-day free trial, so sign up, build your menu, print off a few QR codes, and you will quickly be the only restaurant on your block that's not shutting down early because they're crying out for staff.", "19ba0aba4f76aaa2fc72e7df4306fa15.mp4": "Hold up, you're only paying $700 on rent?\nI know, and you don't even really notice the eight other roommates.\nWhat would you rate this budget on a scale of one to ten?\nI mean, just look at it.

Ad revenue. Unless you're getting tens of millions of views every single month, you will not make a full-time income from ad revenue. And overnight, these platforms can decide to give you significantly less money and you can't do anything about it. Affiliate links. These are a great place to get started, but they can often feel scammy. And unless you're an expert and you're hyper niched down, people probably won't click your links. Sponsorships. From the outside looking in, sponsorships seem like paradise. You just roll out a bed, spend 10 minutes on a video and then get paid two grand. But having worked with many, many creators, sponsorships tend to be the one that burns people out. There are many horror stories of brands fucking over creators. It's a huge amount of pressure to get enough views to feel like you can justify the amount you've been paid. And you have to be hyper niched down in terms of the content type and format if you really want to maximize your results. Also, brands always look at your average view count. And if it drops, you're going to get super stressed. Services are a great way to become less dependent on the platforms for your income. And they unlock significantly more money and more predictable money than the above three methods. However, with services, we're usually trading time for money. And we want to move away from that as soon as we can. Products. Products decouple the relationship between your time and your money. Therefore, meaning you can go to sleep and continue to make money. You can go on holiday and continue to make money. The platforms can change and you'll still make money. Products are by far the highest leverage way to make more money. But I still recommend that you start with services so that you understand the sorts of products that you should build out.", "e1c5215bb81eab186fb525e87eb18cd1.mp4": "Things TikTok made me buy, part 32. I saw a bunch of people using these cute water bottles that you can foam roll with and I just had to try it out for myself. Picking a color was so hard because they have so many patterns and designs to choose from, but ultimately I went with this juicy pattern bottle and I got the blue one for my boyfriend. Hydration is so important to me and drinking two 40 ounce Mobots assures I hit my water intake goal. Plus, I can use it to roll out and massage my muscles. You can stay hydrated at work, foam roll with it at the gym, or even bring it to the beach. The best part is that it is sustainably built with recycled steel and this cushy foam.
