Restaurants cannot keep staff these days, but I might have a way to fix that. Talented staff have a choice where to work, and a lot of them will choose to work somewhere with good tips. So what if I told you you could have bigger check sizes, faster turnovers, and servers could earn 25% more in tips? Are you ready for the catch? It's ready. Ready is a digital menu and ordering software that is just that. It's ready to go. Customers can view a menu and order just by scanning a QR code. This makes customers happy, and happy customers make for happy staff. Digital menus are an absolute must for any restaurant not stuck in the dark ages. But nobody wants a glitchy app or some crazy proprietary hardware. You just want it to be ready. There's currently a 14-day free trial, so sign up, build your menu, print off a few QR codes, and you will quickly be the only restaurant on your block that's not shutting down early because they're crying out for staff.
