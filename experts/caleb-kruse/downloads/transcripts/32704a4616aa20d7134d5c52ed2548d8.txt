Hi everyone, it's Einar Garten. I'm so excited to announce that Le Creuset and I have teamed up to give away over 5,000 free cookware sets to celebrate our new partnership. These cookware sets are an absolute dream in the kitchen and will take your cooking to a whole new level. One thing Le Creuset excels in is their top-tier craftsmanship and durability. Plus, they're stunning to look at. To claim your risk-free set, just cover the small shipping and handling fee and we'll send one straight to your door. All we ask is that you kindly leave a review and share this giveaway with all your friends and family. If you're seeing this ad, then that means we still have some available, so hurry and secure your free set.
