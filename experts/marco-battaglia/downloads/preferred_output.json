I'm the founder of Hotel Lobby Candle. Five years ago, I decided to leave my corporate job to create my own line of candles inspired by the scents inside my favorite hotel lobbies all over the world. I started out with this very ugly prototype that eventually became our signature candle, which was a scent that took me almost a year to perfect. On our launch day, we sold out our entire inventory in 24 minutes, which meant our incredible team was pouring and boxing candles around the clock. Now, almost three years later, we've been featured on Today, Vogue, InStyle, and even the New York Times. We've launched tons of new scents that are available both on our website and at Neiman Marcus.

So, how can you do this? Well, here's the surprising part. Focus on their gut health. You see, while most dog parents start trying ineffective balms and creams, they simply don't realize that the way to help your dog deal with airborne allergens, like pollen, is through adding good probiotics into their gut. Because put simply, the science is now clear that their gut controls everything.

Io mi chiamo Lorenzo Piacentini e sono amministratore delegato di Zegna Baruffa Lane Borgosesia. Questa azienda nasce nel 30 gennaio del 1850 dall'idea rivoluzionaria dei fratelli Antongini. Vennero qua in Valsesia scappando dopo aver costituito le Cinque Giornate di Milano. Era una famiglia rivoluzionaria che ebbe l'idea rivoluzionaria di installare una filatura in queste terre, attraendo forza lavoro da differenti paesi. La parola territorio e la parola persone sono due parole che fanno parte dei valori dell'azienda. Il territorio ci d\u00e0 un DNA di qualit\u00e0 ai nostri prodotti. Non \u00e8 un caso che il distretto tessile di qualit\u00e0 italiano \u00e8 concentrato nel Bielese e nella Valsesia. La purezza dell'acqua ha un particolare effetto sulla qualit\u00e0 della fibra e sulla sua tintura. E in questo ecosistema favorevole sono poi state costruite le competenze di artigianalit\u00e0 e di manifattura. L'industria tessile non \u00e8 un'industria che pu\u00f2 dare delle grosse innovazioni tecnologiche di macchinari. Ci sono ovviamente, ma non sono decisive rispetto all'ecosistema e all'intervento umano. Queste sono due componenti chiave che rendono ancora questo metier terribilmente umano, terribilmente reale e lo trovo molto affascinante. La forza della nostra azienda si riassume nell'umilt\u00e0 di dare un prodotto di alta qualit\u00e0 unito ad un servizio a disposizione della clientela nei tempi e nelle modalit\u00e0 corrette. Per fare un esempio, noi ogni anno abbiamo 35.000 colori in produzione per soddisfare i bisogni cromatici del cliente finale. Zegna Baruffa L'Anneborgosese ha il controllo del 100% della filiera verticale di produzione da quando entra la materia prima fino a quando esce il filato, incluso anche la fase di tintura. Il filato utilizzato per Velasca riunisce le qualit\u00e0 del filato pettinato e del filato cardato in un'unica proposta. Quindi unisce la finezza del filato con la morbidezza e il comfort di utilizzo da parte del cliente finale.", "c0fadacd124554a6610ed84238338795.mp4": "Gonfiore addominale?
