Why did you choose aligners instead of traditional braces? Unlike braces, aligners are transparent and I have no problem wearing them. With braces, it’s hard to eat certain foods. With aligners, on the other hand, I can simply take them out and eat all my favorite snacks. Aligners are so easy to use. Just put them on and voilà, your teeth start moving with each aligner you wear. It’s like getting a smile makeover without any effort or stress. For Black Friday, Dr. Smile has its biggest discount ever. You can save 250 euros on the treatment and receive a free professional whitening kit worth 200 euros.
