Companies like Zegna Baruffa Lane Borgosesia and Velasca have this in common: they tell realistic stories, with substance, that can make you dream. My name is Lorenzo Piacentini and I am the CEO of Zegna Baruffa Lane Borgosesia. This company was founded on January 30, 1850, from the revolutionary idea of the Antongini brothers. They came here to Valsesia after fleeing following their participation in the Five Days of Milan. They were a revolutionary family who had the groundbreaking idea to set up a spinning mill in these lands, attracting labor from different countries. The word “territory” and the word “people” are two words that are part of the company’s values. The territory gives a DNA of quality to our products. It is no coincidence that the Italian high-quality textile district is concentrated between the Biella area and Valsesia. The purity of the water has a special effect on the quality of the fiber and its dyeing. And in this favorable ecosystem, craftsmanship and manufacturing skills have been developed. The textile industry is not one that can offer huge technological innovations in machinery. There are innovations, of course, but they are not decisive compared to the ecosystem and human intervention. These are two key components that still make this métier incredibly human, incredibly real, and I find that very fascinating. The strength of our company lies in the humility to provide a high-quality product combined with customer service delivered at the right time and in the right way. For example, every year we produce 35,000 colors to meet the color needs of the end customer. Zegna Baruffa Lane Borgosesia has 100% control over the vertical production chain, from the moment the raw material enters until the yarn leaves, including the dyeing phase. The yarn used for Velasca combines the qualities of combed yarn and carded yarn in a single offering. Thus, it merges the fineness of the yarn with softness and comfort for the end user.
