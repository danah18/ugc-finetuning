Hi, I'm Lindsay. I'm the founder of Hotel Lobby Candle. Five years ago, I decided to leave my corporate job to create my own line of candles inspired by the scents inside my favorite hotel lobbies all over the world. I started out with this very ugly prototype that eventually became our signature candle, which was a scent that took me almost a year to perfect. On our launch day, we sold out our entire inventory in 24 minutes, which meant our incredible team was pouring and boxing candles around the clock. Now, almost three years later, we've been featured on Today, Vogue, InStyle, and even the New York Times. We've launched tons of new scents that are available both on our website and at Neiman Marcus. So if you like fancy hotels and fancy smells, I have a feeling you will love Hotel Lobby Candle.
