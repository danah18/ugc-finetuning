Is this cream worth the hype? My honest recommendation for especially dry and sensitive skin. This cream does me so much good because the combination of minerals has a calming, antioxidant, and moisturizing effect. Folks, this is exactly what my dry skin needs. The main active ingredients are minerals, as I just mentioned, and of course ceramides, which help restore the skin's natural protective barrier, and niacinamide, which supports the skin’s own cell renewal processes. So I’m already convinced, and just check it out at the NKM studio or online shop—I just find this cream incredibly moisturizing for the ultra-dry season that’s coming up, and that’s why it’s my absolute favorite.
