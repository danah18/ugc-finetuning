Forget your PlayStation 5, forget your Xbox One, this is all you need. This is a retro HDMI stick that you plug into your HDMI outlet, and boom, just like that, you have 10,000 old retro games. You got every game you can imagine on here. You got Dragon Ball Z, King of Fighters, Street Fighter, Super Mario, Sonic, you name it. You get two controllers so you can play versus your friend, and this thing is amazing. Look, you even got Pokemon on this thing.
