As I've gotten older, the negative effects of coffee are hitting harder. Acid reflux, digestive issues, increased heart rate, jitters, you name it. But the problem wasn't coffee. It was the high levels of caffeine that took a toll on my body. So instead of quitting, I made an upgrade with Everyday Dose. They use a delicious blend of superfood mushrooms, L-theanine, and collagen protein to give me clean energy, laser sharp focus, and mental clarity. I get to keep the taste and energy of real coffee with 80% less caffeine and zero nasty side effects. On top of that, Lion's Mane supports my memory and nerve regeneration, while Chaga is loaded with antioxidants to help reduce inflammation and immunity. They're also one of the only mushroom coffees that has collagen protein, so I get healthier hair, skin, and nails too. And if you don't love it, they'll give you your money back. I even got my husband to drink it every day, and he hates regular coffee. Make the upgrade and try it today.
