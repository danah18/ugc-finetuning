I love this question because I'm about to show you the number one way you can save money on expensive perfumes in the future. It's called the Essence Vault and it's inspired by luxury perfumes for a fraction of the cost. I finished two bottles already and I'll be honest with you, it's the only thing I wear nowadays. It's actually a no-brainer for me because it smells exactly the same as designer perfume, lasts just as long, but I'm paying a lot less. Look, I'm an extreme guy. I don't just do behind the neck. Because it costs a lot less, I go... I spray it everywhere. It's such a big hack. Trust me, you won't regret it.
