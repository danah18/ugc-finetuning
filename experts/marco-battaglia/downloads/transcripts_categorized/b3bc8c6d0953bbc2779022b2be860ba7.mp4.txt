}, Let me introduce you to the best way to get your vitamins in. This is Huel's new A to Z daily vitamin drink. I have been loving this drink. So easy, so convenient, and most of all, delicious. First time trying. That tastes so good. I'm shocked. With 26 vitamins and minerals, 154 health benefits, and only 30 calories per can. 100% of your recommended daily intake for 15 vitamins. 400% of your recommended intake of vitamin D. No way. It just gets better and better. And if you don't like the caffeinated version, we've got a little caffeine-free option as well. I actually can't explain to you how good that tastes. Cheers.
