}, I don't know about you, but I get dark underarms. This is what I use to treat them. Let's get into it. I start off with this exfoliator which lightens and buffs away dull, dead skin. Then I make sure to shave with this coconut shave cream. Not only does it smell amazing, but it combats ingrowns and irritation, which lead to scarring. No thank you. Last, I pop on this body potion that speeds cell turnover for fresher, brighter skin.
