{'brand_name': 'MoBot', 'product_description': 'A reusable water bottle that doubles as a foam roller for muscle massage, made from recycled steel and cushy foam. It comes in various patterns and designs, helping users stay hydrated and aiding in muscle recovery.'}, Things TikTok made me buy, part 32. I saw a bunch of people using these cute water bottles that you can foam roll with, and I just had to try it out for myself. Picking a color was so hard because they have so many patterns and designs to choose from, but ultimately I went with this juicy patterned bottle, and I got the blue one for my boyfriend. Hydration is so important to me, and drinking two 40-ounce MoBots assures I hit my water intake goal. Plus, I can use it to roll out and massage my muscles. You can stay hydrated at work, foam roll with it at the gym, or even bring it to the beach. The best part is that it is sustainably built with recycled steel and this cushy foam. No more wasting countless plastic water bottles.
