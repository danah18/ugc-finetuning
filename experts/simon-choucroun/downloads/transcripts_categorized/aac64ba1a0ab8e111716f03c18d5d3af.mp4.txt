}, No, it's actually amazing how much more credible people seem to think you are when you're just pretending to be on a podcast. Like, you don't even have to do that much. It's just, all you really have to do is just look to the side of the camera as opposed to looking into the camera. And people are like, wow, this guy must be really important to be on a podcast. I'm ready to buy whatever supplement he's trying to sell me, whatever kind of life coaching crap he's trying to sell me. He's a credible guy that's on a podcast.
