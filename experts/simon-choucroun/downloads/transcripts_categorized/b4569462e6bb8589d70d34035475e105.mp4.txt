}, I'm trying Javi coffee concentrate today. I'm super excited. It's my first time trying a microdose coffee concentrate. So you only use a teaspoon or two with whatever liquid of your choosing. And we're gonna see how it tastes. I'm using vanilla almond milk. And it says like a teaspoon or two for every six ounces. I don't know how much. That looks okay. It smells so good. I'm gonna start with a teaspoon. I'm using this little gold straw. Look how cute. I think I'm gonna do two teaspoons. It looks too pale. Actually first I'll try it. Yeah it needs more. We're trying another teaspoon. Okay that was the perfect amount. It's super good. It tastes just like cold brew. My final review is that this is super good. I love coffee and this tastes exactly like a cold brew you would buy at the store. And you just refrigerate it after opening. So freaking convenient. Like if you want to try some for yourself I do have a discount code that I'll share. And you can also get these gold straws. But I highly recommend if you love coffee. It's a cool little thing. Like you wouldn't think this concentrate would get you an actual cold brew or iced coffee. Whatever you want to call it. But it does.
