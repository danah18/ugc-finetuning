}, One of the best promotional strategies you can do for your podcast is create small little shareable clips for social media. This is done wrong so often. And it's because typically people aren't using captions. They're not creating catchy headlines that make you want to consume the content. So of course no one's going to want to listen to the full episode. Make them addicting. Make it like the best piece of the pie right there in the center. Or if you like the crust, make it really good so people want to consume more. That's how you're going to get more listeners.
