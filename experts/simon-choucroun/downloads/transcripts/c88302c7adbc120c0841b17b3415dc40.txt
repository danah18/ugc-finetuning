Skinny people, what's your secret?

I have naps for dinner.

1. Sports. 2. Laziness, to get food when I'm hungry, kinda like right now.

I shit everything I eat immediately.

Constant stress and anxiety leave me with no appetite.

If you don't buy it at the store, then you can't eat it at home. Not only are you removing the temptation, you're likely saving money too. I have to do this with alcohol.

Eating slower, you'd be surprised how you were actually full 15 bites ago. Your brain catches up with your stomach too late when you eat fast. Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to finish what's on your plate.

Play video games and usually forget to eat or eat small amounts throughout the day.

Stop eating when you're not hungry. Don't finish your plate and save it for later.

Parents who never forced us to clean our plates, we did have to try one bite of everything, never took us to McDonald's except when we were on road trips, never bought snack foods or sodas and only made desserts on birthdays or holidays. I brought up my kids the same way, and they are skinny too.

When I felt healthiest, it's because I cut out three D's: drinks, desserts, and dining out. If you remove those three things, you'd be amazed how much healthier your diet feels overall.

Eat less. Shit more.
