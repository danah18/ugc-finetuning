I have LA apartment horror stories, I'm talking bed bugs, roaches, robberies, mold, you name it, I have been through it. That's why when you rent an apartment, it's so important to get renters insurance. I have mine through Lemonade, it's inexpensive and it was super fast to get. If you're moving, give yourself peace of mind and get renters insurance.
