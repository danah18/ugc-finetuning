Let me ask you a question. Do you shave your balls? My girl usually shaves them. She shaves it for you? Yeah, she shaves it for me. That's proper. You don't even have to do anything. You just sit there, kick back, relax, and she takes care of it. Exactly. She does all the work. How far back does she go? Just the balls, and she goes further back, keeps everything nice and tight. I just tell her what to do. Give her specific instructions. She's like a trimmer, a razor. Usually like scissors. Oh, scissors. That's like pruning a bonsai tree. She sounds like an expert. You should hold on to that one. It's not just one particular girl. Oh, it's many. It's more than one. You train all of them individually to trim your balls for you? Oh, yeah. You've got like a harem situation going on, and everyone has specific instructions? Yeah, pretty much. You have the left one one day, and go to the next one, do the right one. I ask you, who the hell trimmed your left one yesterday? Yeah. You're an impressive man.
