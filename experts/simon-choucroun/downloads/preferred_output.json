She shaves it for you? Yeah, she shaves it for me. That's proper. You don't even have to do anything. You just sit there, kick back, relax, and she takes care of it. Exactly. She does all the work. How far back does she go? Just the balls, and she goes further back, keeps everything nice and tight. I just tell her what to do. Give her specific instructions. She's like a trimmer, a razor. Usually like scissors. Oh, scissors. That's like pruning a bonsai tree. She sounds like an expert. You should hold on to that one. It's not just one particular girl. Oh, it's many. It's more than one. You train all of them individually to trim your balls for you? Oh, yeah. You've got like a harem situation going on, and everyone has specific instructions? Yeah, pretty much.

So you only use a teaspoon or two with whatever liquid of your choosing. And we're gonna see how it tastes. I'm using vanilla almond milk. And it says like a teaspoon or two for every six ounces. I don't know how much. That looks okay. It smells so good. I'm gonna start with a teaspoon. I'm using this little gold straw. Look how cute. I think I'm gonna do two teaspoons. It looks too pale. Actually first I'll try it. Yeah it needs more. We're trying another teaspoon. Okay that was the perfect amount. It's super good. It tastes just like cold brew. My final review is that this is super good. I love coffee and this tastes exactly like a cold brew you would buy at the store. And you just refrigerate it after opening. So freaking convenient. Like if you want to try some for yourself I do have a discount code that I'll share. And you can also get these gold straws. But I highly recommend if you love coffee. It's a cool little thing. Like you wouldn't think this concentrate would get you an actual cold brew or iced coffee. Whatever you want to call it.

Laziness, to get food when I'm hungry, kinda like right now.\n\nI shit everything I eat immediately.\n\nConstant stress and anxiety leave me with no appetite.\n\nIf you don't buy it at the store, then you can't eat it at home. Not only are you removing the temptation, you're likely saving money too. I have to do this with alcohol.\n\nEating slower, you'd be surprised how you were actually full 15 bites ago. Your brain catches up with your stomach too late when you eat fast. Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to finish what's on your plate.\n\nPlay video games and usually forget to eat or eat small amounts throughout the day.\n\nStop eating when you're not hungry. Don't finish your plate and save it for later.\n\nParents who never forced us to clean our plates, we did have to try one bite of everything, never took us to McDonald's except when we were on road trips, never bought snack foods or sodas and only made desserts on birthdays or holidays. I brought up my kids the same way, and they are skinny too.\n\nWhen I felt healthiest, it's because I cut out three D's: drinks, desserts, and dining out.

This is done wrong so often. And it's because typically people aren't using captions. They're not creating catchy headlines that make you want to consume the content. So of course no one's going to want to listen to the full episode. Make them addicting. Make it like the best piece of the pie right there in the center. Or if you like the crust, make it really good so people want to consume more. That's how you're going to get more listeners."}
