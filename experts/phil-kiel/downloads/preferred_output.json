I just hope you can see the improvement in my skin because I can certainly see it. I just think it's really obvious, like, it's so clear how much my skin has improved.

Two, it has an antibacterial effect against acne-causing bacteria, hyperpigmentation, rosacea. It's good. I personally really like the one from Face Theory. This is their S9 serum. I'm just going to show you the before and afters here just so you can see. Apply it at night. Just a few drops into the areas that are troublesome. So onto your blemishes, any areas of pigmentation. I find a lot of azelaic acid quite gritty but actually this one isn't because the azelaic acid is fully dissolved. It's 15% so it is strong so just be careful.

There is a new salicylic acid in town, and it's this product, Facetheory Salietica 2% Toner. Online, lots of people are calling this out as being a perfect dupe for the Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant. Half the price, but very similar ingredient and profile. So, I put one on order to put it through its paces. Does it actually live up to the Paula's Choice option, which has been a cult favourite for so many people? Let's start with the pros first. I prefer the ingredient profile of this. It's got a good concentration of centella asiatica to calm, hydrate, and soothe the skin. You've got a great concentration of that salicylic acid, and it's half the price of Paula's Choice. What's not to love? In terms of the drawbacks, I think the Paula's Choice one is a little bit less drying on the skin, so it'll work better for drier skin types, whereas the Facetheory could be game-changing and something I'd switch to if you have an oily, acne-prone skin type.
