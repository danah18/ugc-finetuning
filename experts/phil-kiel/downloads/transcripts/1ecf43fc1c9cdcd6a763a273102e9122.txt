If you want thick, strong and shiny hair, follow this hair oiling routine. Pour the Fushi Really Good Hair Oil into your hand. Massage it into your ends and roots, leaving it for a minimum of 30 minutes or for better results overnight. Wash the oil out of your hair and style as usual. The results really do speak for themselves.
