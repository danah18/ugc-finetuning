I've just recently turned 40. I've got like fine lines and wrinkles. I've got all these little red things going on. My skin feels really dry. I seem to have loads of breakouts all over my chin. I'm trying Wild Mint's Superfood Skincare Kit. There's five products in here. They're vegan, they're cruelty free. I just hope that it gets rid of some of these issues. It's day four and I have to say I'm already starting to see results. Something's going on. The redness has reduced. My skin feels plump. It's dewy. It feels like it's not dry. Looking forward to what the next 10 days have in store. I actually have no makeup on for once. Feeling really confident in my skin right now and it's only day seven. This is the first time in my adult life that I've ever gone out without makeup to a lunch date. My skin looks really good. The fine lines and wrinkles seems to have kind of disappeared. All the little spots that I had on here have gone. I feel really confident in my skin. Thanks to Wild Mint.
