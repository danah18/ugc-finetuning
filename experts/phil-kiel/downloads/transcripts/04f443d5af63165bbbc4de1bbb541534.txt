If you're like me and suffer from neck pain, then listen up. My physio told me it's due to poor posture when working on my laptop. He recommended I try the Groove Pillow. It works to correct your posture whilst you sleep to relieve neck pain and improve sleep quality. This pillow has genuinely changed my life. I now sleep through the night and I wake up without neck pain. If you struggle with neck pain, this is the last pillow you'll ever need.
