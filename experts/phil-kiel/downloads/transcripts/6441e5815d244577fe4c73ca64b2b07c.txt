To nourish my skin in the morning, I use Fushi Really Good Muscle and Joints Oil. It contains nutrient-rich oils and herbs that boost circulation and support sleepy bodies. I take ashwagandha to calm my nervous system. This ancient herb adapts to whatever your body is calling for. Mid-morning, I like to make a golden milk. I crush up a mixture of herbs and spices and mix with coconut milk, organic ghee, and water. Once it's warm, I add raw organic turmeric juice from Fushi. A healing and powerful antioxidant. Sipping on warm golden milk fills my body with warm energy, ready for the day ahead.
