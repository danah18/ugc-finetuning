Okay guys, stop scrolling. Let me tell you about this amazing solid perfume from Sweden. It's called Ingrid and I'm honestly obsessed with it. First off, it's environmentally friendly, it's great for sensitive skin, and it smells so amazing. I also love the fact that it's easy to apply and it's super compact so I can just bring it with me on the go. No need to bring your bulky perfume bottles anywhere. You need to try this.
