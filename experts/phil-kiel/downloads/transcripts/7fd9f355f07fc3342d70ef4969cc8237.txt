So I only wear merino bras and I love them. I love that they don't stink like nylon bras when I wear them several days in a row. This bra in particular is super light and doesn't roll or dig into my skin and leave marks. It's so comfortable, I forget I'm even wearing it. It's from Branwyn. They're the only bras I wear.
