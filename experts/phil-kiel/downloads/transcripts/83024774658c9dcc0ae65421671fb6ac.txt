Consistently using Sharp Pores hair growth serum because it does really work super well. And the best part about this product is that it gets absorbed into the scalp and you can put it in after styling your hair and it does not make your hair look greasy. I've been focusing on these areas kind of underneath my hair that are just full of fine baby hairs. So I just use the dropper, put a little bit, massage it into the scalp, and go about my day.
