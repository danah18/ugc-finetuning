How my skin went from this to this. I have to put quite a lot of makeup on to get enough confidence to leave the house. I've got hormone acne, especially around my chin area and my forehead area. I'm really excited to be trying Wild Mint's 5 Step Superfood Clear Skin Kit. It's day 21. My skin feels so much plumper, so much more hydrated. My spots going down and the scars are clearing and I'm going to work without any makeup on. These are the final results using Wild Mint for about a month now. My skin feels so much more hydrated. As you can see, I am glowing. My blemishes have gone down so, so much. The redness has gone down. My skin feels so much better and so much healthier. My confidence has absolutely soared.
