So people keep asking me how I stay so healthy despite all the season changes, and my secret for that is Dirty's Immunity Bundle. This bundle includes three mushroom blends. Chaga, reishi, the mushroom coffee pouch. Now each one serves a different purpose. Chaga gives me more energy, maintains my health. Reishi helps me release stress and also sleep like a baby. Mushroom coffee gives me the real coffee experience with better energy and focus. Also, I never have any crashes or jitters after drinking it. The best part is all three drinks have a direct positive effect on my immunity. I honestly want to drink multiple cups a day, but it's only recommended to drink one teaspoon a day. I also noticed that once I started drinking these, my sugary snack and food cravings totally stopped because it just tastes so good. And I haven't gotten sick ever since I started to drink them.
