Mushrooms are one of the most powerful superfoods in the world and have such a good array of benefits. And Dirty have lots of different mushroom blends that actually taste good to make you getting in your mushrooms a lot easier. So I've been drinking mushroom coffee and mushroom blends from Dirty for the last three to four weeks. And when I tell you my focus, my energy and my digestion is much better, I really do mean it. There are literally mornings where I've drank the mushrooms and felt absolutely on it. I've been so productive and really increased my focus. So the ones I'm recommending you to try together is the mushroom coffee and also the Dirty Lion's Mane. This is the best for focus and also productivity.
