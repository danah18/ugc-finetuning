Welcome to another day of heatwave fall. The only thing I had today was Pilates, so I went for a little ballet core moment with this wrap top over my workout set. I've been really enjoying this solo routine of going to my Pilates class and taking this time purely for me. Afterward, I gazed longingly at books, successfully didn't buy any, before going home.
