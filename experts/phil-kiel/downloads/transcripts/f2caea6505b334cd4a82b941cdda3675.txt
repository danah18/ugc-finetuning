The best thing I've done for my productivity is switching to mushrooms instead of coffee. I relied on coffee for almost four years and I just couldn't keep ignoring the way it affected me. The crazy jitters, the afternoon crash, and I slept terribly at night. So I decided to give Level Up a try. It's an adaptogenic mushroom blend. I've been using it for the past two weeks now and the results have been great so far. It's really easy. You just add some powder, add some water, you stir and enjoy. It's really refreshing. Plus, after two weeks, gone are the jitters, the afternoon crash. I have a much more sustained energy level now. I don't feel hype. I feel like more zen-like, focused throughout the day. I've never been as productive and focused before. Just go to the website and try it out for yourself. You can try it risk-free today.
