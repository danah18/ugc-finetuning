Glow Recipe finally released their new serum. Strawberry Smooth BHA and AHA Salicylic Serum. If you've been looking for something to help smooth your skin and treat and prevent those breakouts, look no further. This serum is going to make your skin so smooth. Blackheads on my nose are almost gone. Pores are refined. It has really helped clear up the texture and prevent some new blemishes from forming. I love that it makes my skin like it can breathe, and I get that iconic Glow Recipe glow. I honestly think that you guys will love this serum. It's so cute and you have to try it.
