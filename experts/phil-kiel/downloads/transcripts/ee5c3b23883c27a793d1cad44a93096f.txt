My money don't jiggle jiggle, it folds. I like to see you wiggle wiggle, for sure. It makes me want to dribble dribble, you know. Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it. Six feet two in a compact, no slack, but luckily the seats go back. I got a knack to relax in my mind, sipping some red, red wine.
