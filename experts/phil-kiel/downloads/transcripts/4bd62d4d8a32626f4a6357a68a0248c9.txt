This really good hair oil from Fushi has been incredible for my thinning and damaged hair caused by menopause and stress. The jasmine scent is divine and really adds to this relaxing ritual. The mix of herbs and nourishing oils helps to stimulate follicle growth and prevent split ends. Scalp massage has become a grounding daily self-care practice for me and my hair is feeling stronger, bouncier and shiny.
