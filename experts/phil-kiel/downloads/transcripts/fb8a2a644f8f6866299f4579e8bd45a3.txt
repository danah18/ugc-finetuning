If your skin is like this and you're suffering from redness and breakouts, you might want to start using azelaic acid in your skincare. There's two main factors of azelaic acid that you want to know. Firstly, it's an antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation. Two, it has an antibacterial effect against acne-causing bacteria, hyperpigmentation, rosacea. It's good. I personally really like the one from Face Theory. This is their S9 serum. I'm just going to show you the before and afters here just so you can see. Apply it at night. Just a few drops into the areas that are troublesome. So onto your blemishes, any areas of pigmentation. I find a lot of azelaic acid quite gritty but actually this one isn't because the azelaic acid is fully dissolved. It's 15% so it is strong so just be careful. It all goes a long way with this formula. Let me know your thoughts down below. I personally really like it.
