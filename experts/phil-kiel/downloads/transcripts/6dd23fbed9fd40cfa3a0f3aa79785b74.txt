Meet my new favorite healthy habit. Sipping bone broth regularly has helped me in so many ways that I kind of wish I started sooner. And Kettle & Fire definitely has the best flavor of any that I've tried. They have beef, they have chicken, they have a ginger turmeric, but my favorite is definitely the classic chicken. Plus, they only use high quality organic ingredients, so I can incorporate this into my favorite recipes. But I actually prefer to just simmer and sip it. Mmm, it's so good.
