I work as a model, and due to excessive heat styling and heavy use of hair products, I was experiencing massive fallouts and my hair was very dry. I know how critical it is to take care of my hair, especially due to my job. So I did some research and found this best-selling hair growth serum. Peta Growth Serum has natural components that delay hair shedding and encourage hair growth. I apply two to three drops in the problematic areas every day, and after just six weeks, my hair looks incredible!
