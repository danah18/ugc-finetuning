My bedside table was starting to look like a pharmacy with all of the medicines and painkillers that I was taking. I've made a change to fushi products, their supplements and their body products to help me nourish my body in a more natural way. In particular, their turmeric blend with curcumin and black pepper has helped enormously with some of that stiffness and pain that I get through my joints due to my arthritis. I've also started using their muscle and joint oil. I'm having a far more restful sleep, I'm not taking as many painkillers, and my bedside table's looking a lot better too.
