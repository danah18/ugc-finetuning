Our most complimented scent, Glossier You, now is available in a rollerball. The Glossier You rollerball comes with eight milliliters, which is the perfect size for on the go or if you want to try the scent before you commit to a full size. If you're wondering what's the difference between the solid and the rollerball, the solid is more for layering and it sits close to the skin. The rollerball has the same formula as a full-size perfume with the same warm, slightly peppery, musky skin scent that smells different on everyone.
