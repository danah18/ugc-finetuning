}, You find yourself often searching for words. You should see this. Lion's Mane is my new favorite morning pick-me-up. No jitters, no brain fog, and no caffeine. It gently brings me to a state of focus that actually lasts. There's no kick or hyper effect that I used to feel when I drink coffee, and it doesn't even affect my sleep. They have a lot of studies on their website showing that Lion's Mane helps with cognitive function, increased focus, and improved memory.
