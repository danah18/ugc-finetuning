}, Let me tell you about my new beauty hack. So, trimella mushroom can hold a thousand times its weight in water, creating this jelly-like moisturizer in the mushroom. So, what it's actually done for my skin is unbelievable. I used to suffer from dry skin, rosacea, and a little bit of acne on my cheeks. I started drinking trimella and it has completely transformed the way my skin feels. It's no longer flaky and feels super hydrated. I've been told it's nature's hyaluronic acid, so I've introduced it into my daily routine. I take a teaspoon of it every day and I drink it with a hot water. It's how I start my day every day.
