}, Guys, I have the most amazing perfume brand to show you. It's basically a sustainable luxury perfume brand. It's called Potion Paris. This gorgeous iconic crystal vial that you put your refill in. And these are the refills. So basically once you've used these up. All of their perfumes are made from natural ingredients and are totally toxin and chemical free. It's a sustainable brand. Basically they plant a tree for every set that they set. It's something you can feel like really good about using because you're giving back and they're a company that tries to use as many recycled products as possible to create what they do. This is the set that I've got and I'm sorry but that actually looks real.
