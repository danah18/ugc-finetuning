}, I will be using this weekly now. One of the things that I really love about this is it has really buildable coverage. It gives like a beautiful color. It really has no orange tone at all. It leaves you with that like a beautiful fresh from the beach glow. I am absolutely obsessed with how this turned out. There is no harsh chemicals. It's an ultra buildable formula, which means there's no orange tone. So it really gives you just a nice beautiful tan. Zero orange tone. So you're not going to be left with any streaks. It contains hyaluronic acid. So it's going to not only moisturize your skin, but it also contains anti-aging properties. It's really just the perfect self-tanner to use, especially if you have to walk out the door within 20 minutes or so. Not to mention just the beautiful color that this tan gives you. Take the Power Match quiz, see which formula is right for you, and try it for free 14 days. You can take it home, try out the formula for yourself, see what the hype is about, and thank me later.
