}, Get unready with me using my favorite skincare set from Urban Beta. Getting ready for bed is my favorite time of the day because it means I'm getting closer to sleeping. I remove my makeup and cleanse with the Radiance Exfoliating Facial Polish. I exfoliate my skin two to three times a week to reduce breakouts. After cleansing, I use the Radiance Replenishing Night Cream. This is great for dry skin and it helps fade pigmentation. So if you're like me and you struggle with acne scarring, this one is definitely for you. I like to lightly massage that into my skin. Then I go in with the Reviving Facial Oil. This stuff makes my skin so glowy and hydrated. And that's how I get ready for bed. Goodnight!
