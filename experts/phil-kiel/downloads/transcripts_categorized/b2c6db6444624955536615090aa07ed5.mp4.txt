}, So I will drink Lion's Mane to clear my brain fog and have sharper focus for the rest of the day. Lion's Mane is a potent mushroom coming from the mountains of Fujian, and it's a perfect alternative for coffee to stay focused and energetic throughout the day. It never gives you the caffeine crash that coffee would give. On top of that, it clears your mind and increases your mood so you feel so much better after drinking it. The interesting part is that these are based on actual studies, not just assumptions. So anytime I take a sip of Lion's Mane, I feel like this is just a no-brainer to have it in your daily routine.
