}, This is my skin unfiltered, unmakeuped. I'm going to try this for the next two weeks and I'm going to see how my skin looks after those two weeks. So I thought I would document the journey. So this is my skin on day one. Okay, and this is my skin on day 14 or 15. I definitely feel like the redness has dramatically reduced. I've been noticing I've been having a lot less breakouts. This was my skin on day 18. As you can see, those spots that I did have had basically disappeared and my skin was just looking really nice and bright. This is my skin on day 30. I just hope you can see the improvement in my skin because I can certainly see it. I just think it's really obvious, like, it's so clear how much my skin has improved. WildMe just have such good trust pilot reviews. They also have a money back guarantee. I tried every recommended skincare and just nothing had helped, but I was up for trying something new and I'm really glad that I did.
