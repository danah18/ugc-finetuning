  "product_description": "A facial toner containing 2% salicylic acid, designed to exfoliate, calm, hydrate, and soothe the skin. It is particularly recommended for oily, acne-prone skin types and serves as a more affordable alternative to the Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant."
}, Hey guys, welcome back to Mad About Skin. In today's video, we are saying move over Paula's Choice. There is a new salicylic acid in town, and it's this product, Facetheory Salietica 2% Toner. Online, lots of people are calling this out as being a perfect dupe for the Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant. Half the price, but very similar ingredient and profile. So, I put one on order to put it through its paces. Does it actually live up to the Paula's Choice option, which has been a cult favourite for so many people? Let's start with the pros first. I prefer the ingredient profile of this. It's got a good concentration of centella asiatica to calm, hydrate, and soothe the skin. You've got a great concentration of that salicylic acid, and it's half the price of Paula's Choice. What's not to love? In terms of the drawbacks, I think the Paula's Choice one is a little bit less drying on the skin, so it'll work better for drier skin types, whereas the Facetheory could be game-changing and something I'd switch to if you have an oily, acne-prone skin type. Take care!
