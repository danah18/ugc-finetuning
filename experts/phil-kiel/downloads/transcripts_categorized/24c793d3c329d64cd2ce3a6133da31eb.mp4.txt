}, My routine using products from Fushi. I start by cleansing with jojoba oil, gentle and balancing, hydrating my skin. Then rosehip oil to repair and add radiance, reducing those fine lines and pigmentation. Their really good hair oil helps repair the damage and thinning caused by menopause and stress. It smells divine and my hair is left feeling strong, bouncy and shiny.
