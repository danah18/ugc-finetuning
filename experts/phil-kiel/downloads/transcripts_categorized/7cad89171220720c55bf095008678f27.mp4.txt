}, Since being pregnant, I've become super picky with what perfumes I wear and what scents I like. So I was actually super excited to try out the Glossier You collection because I've heard nothing but amazing things about it. So I had loads of errands to run today and I wanted to do a wear test of the brand new rollerball format of the You perfume to see how it lasts throughout the day. There's also a solid formula of the perfume which comes in the cutest packaging and quite literally melts into your skin. So I went and finished off all my errands, I literally got drenched in the rain and I still smell amazing. But I can confirm by the end of the day, the scent really grew on me and I really love all the different formats it comes in. Definitely a scent I know I'll be reaching for.
