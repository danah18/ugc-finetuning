}, I hope you're paying attention because I'm about to put you guys onto the perfect serum. Like if you have dry skin, just like dull, tired looking skin and like obvious fine lines, kind of like I do, you have to try this serum. So this is Face Theory's hyaluronic acid serum. It's so nourishing and it's so hydrating for my dry skin. You can try stamping your skin with a toner or a mist and then just put a few drops in your palm like that, press it into your skin like so. I love that this isn't sticky or greasy and it pairs well with everything else in my routine. You follow hyaluronic acid with your regular moisturizer and you have happy, healthy skin. There's your find.
