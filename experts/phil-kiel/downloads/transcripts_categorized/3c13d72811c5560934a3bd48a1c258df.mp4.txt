}, This is the best natural herb for ADHD. I also recommend this to all my clients that have any kind of brain fog. According to this study, the reason why it's so powerful for ADHD is because it has these two compounds that help stimulate brain cell growth. Better yet, it doesn't overstimulate your neurotransmitters and it doesn't completely destroy your liver like pharmaceutical drugs. In fact, it has side benefits, not side effects. And I recently learned that it's better to have it in powdered form because it makes the compounds more bioactive and bioavailable, meaning that it's easier for your gut to assimilate and absorb. I personally like to have it as an espresso in the morning or sometimes I add milk because lion's mane actually tastes like coffee. Cheers, enjoy!
