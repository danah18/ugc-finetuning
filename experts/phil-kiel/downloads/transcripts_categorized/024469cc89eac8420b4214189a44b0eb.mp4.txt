}, I'm a 45-year-old mom of two. When you're perimenopausal, your body produces less collagen and estrogen. I'm noticing the effects that that has on my skin. It's feeling really dehydrated. I've definitely got more fine lines and wrinkles. I usually just use supermarket products. I'm trying Wild Mint Superfood Skincare. They contain natural collagen-boosting ingredients. It's a simple routine that you use daily in five really easy steps. My skin already feels fantastic, and it's only day one. I'm on day three. In just literally three days, it feels clearer. It definitely feels more hydrated, and it feels a lot softer. It's day five. My dark circles under my eyes are feeling much brighter. The fine lines and wrinkles, especially around here, crow's feet, are feeling smoother. It's been seven days now. I'm absolutely thrilled with the results. My fine lines and wrinkles are feeling smoother, and the dark circles are definitely feeling brighter. I'm looking forward to the future. I feel really great.
