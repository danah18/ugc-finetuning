Little did I know this would be the vacation that Greg proposed to me. We were drinking, we were eating, we were doing all the things, and I was taking my greens, which was a new product at this point, every single day, twice a day.Like day two or three of the trip, and you're like, why do I still feel like fine? I was not experiencing the same bloating that I was on a regular basis when I was eating and drinking that much. I mean, my hangover was better, the bloating was better, and I was like, holy shit, I think this product is the one.
