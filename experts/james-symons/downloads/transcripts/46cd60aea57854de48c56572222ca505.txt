I used to get razor bumps all the time until I threw out my multiblade razors. There is a new shaving system that is guaranteed to eliminate razor bumps, and man does it look good doing it. Multiblades cut hair deep under the surface and cause razor bumps. OneBlade uses a single blade to cut hair at the surface, leaving no irritation, no razor bumps, just a perfectly close shave. I mean, listen to that. This razor is built to last, it's got tons of great reviews, and it's only $25. Toss that multiblade razor and get a OneBlade. You will not regret it.
