These are my favorite jeans and they come from a company called The Perfect Jean. And they are my everyday jeans because they look like normal, regular jeans, but they stretch almost like sweatpants. But you'd never know, you'd never know. Look at these things, they just fit my whole butt. Never uncomfortable. I can stretch, I can squat, I can do whatever I want. Look at that. Everything that you want in a jean that you didn't even know was possible. These jeans have them. Perfectjean.nyc. Go get them now.
