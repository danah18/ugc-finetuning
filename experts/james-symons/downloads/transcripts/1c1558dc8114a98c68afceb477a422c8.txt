Rating from one to ten? A nine. Why not a ten? Truff jalapeno lime, the internet loves it, but what about the streets? Let's find out. One, two, three, and cheers. I really like it. That's a ten for me, I love it. You get the truffle right away. It's got a good heat to it. I'm feeling like in my home country again. Magic flavors. I like it a lot, I would say ten. What do you think? You definitely get the lime. Get a little bit of the lime, get a little jalapeno. It's creamy, I guess that's the truffle. A little sweet, a little tangy. It can go very good with chicken, fish tacos as well. For the vegans, put in salads. Ten. I said ten. I give it a ten. I give it a ten. Oh sure, why not. Ten. Yes!
