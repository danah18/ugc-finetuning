Things in my house that just make sense. Drinking edition. I hated the feeling of hangovers the next day, so I decided to cut back on drinking. This non-alcoholic wine from Shirley is it. I'm really impressed because it tastes like real wine minus the alcohol. It has less calories, gluten-free, and it's vegan. Add Shirley to your house today.
