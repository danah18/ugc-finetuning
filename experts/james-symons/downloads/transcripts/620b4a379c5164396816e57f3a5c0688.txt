The ultimate life hack. Ice drink that's really sweaty and a stick of deodorant. Apply the deodorant to your ice drink. Watch it soak up the sweat. This is not how you do it. I keep seeing this dumb hack where people are putting deodorant on their ice coffee to stop it from sweating. This is why a java sock exists. To stop the sweating, to stop the condensation, it keeps your drink cold for hours. I got this like three hours ago. Still ice in this coffee. I'm obsessed with these. I literally have a draw of them. Look at all of my java socks. This is so dumb. Stop putting deodorant on your coffee. Please buy a java sock. My java sock is my only accessory that goes with me everywhere. One in my purse. One in my car. One at my desk. One in my diaper bag. It doesn't just keep my coffee colder for longer. I no longer have to deal with puddles on my desk or in my cup holder or wrapping gross wet napkins around my cup to try and get it to stop sweating. Look, I may be a hot mess sometimes, but my ice coffee will not be. Look how freaking cute this is. It's amazing. I gifted one to myself because I deserve it. I deserve to have my morning coffee or refresher and not have my hands all cold. I'm a girl who loves a good aesthetic and just look at this pattern. So adorable. Animal prints? Yup. Camo? Yup. Floral? Duh. If you drink iced coffee, get yourself a java sock. It's 1000% worth it. Cheers!
