}, Rise, I want my money back. I finished your 30-day supply in like 17 days. What? Okay, I'm joking. Take all my money. This stuff is cracked. Maybe that explains how I drink three cups of this every day. My friend got me on this at first, telling me how good it would be for my mood, energy, and focus. And I love coffee, so I figured, why not? And let me tell you, this stuff kicks coffee's butt. Because not only is it rich, smooth, and creamy like your favorite brew, but it's also really good for you. Like, really good. Every scoop is packed with adaptogenic mushrooms that heal your body and mind. Lion's mane for brain support, cordyceps for energy and stamina, reishi for better sleep, turkey tail to heal your gut, king trumpet for immunity and to fight inflammation, and shiitake for heart health. Thousands of people love starting their mornings off with a fresh, warm cup of Rise, and I can see why. Go grab a bag and try it for 30 days risk-free. Go quickly before they sell out.
