  "product_description": "Toothpaste bits (small chewable tablets) that serve as a sustainable alternative to traditional toothpaste, coming in refillable glass jars and offering benefits like teeth whitening, strengthening, and anti-cavity protection."
}, Three reasons why I regret buying these toothpaste bits from Byte. Number one, it makes me so frustrated at how long I was using wasteful toothpaste tubes since these are way better for the environment as they come in refillable glass jars. Number two, my teeth have never looked so nice and shiny, I'm upset I didn't find this sooner. And number three, my friends noticed a difference in my smile and keep asking me about Byte. I love using these every day not only because I know I'm making a smarter and more sustainable choice, but there's so many benefits for my teeth like strengthening, anti-cavity, and naturally whitening. I know I'm making a difference in my smile and the planet since switching to Byte. So if you're ready to be addicted, check out these toothpaste bits at trybyte.com.
