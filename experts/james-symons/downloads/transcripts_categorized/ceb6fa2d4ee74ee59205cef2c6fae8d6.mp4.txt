}, This saves me a ton of time because it only takes like five minutes to make. I work Monday to Friday and I decided to switch out my lunch for Huel. I know that I'm getting a nutritious lunch without having to worry about going to the grocery store, finding the food I want, so much easier. Having the Mexican chili today, I already ate this whole thing. Chicken and mushroom, that is so good. Honestly, I could eat this for like every meal. So it only takes a minute, it's really good for you, and it's cheap. And it just tastes so good, guys.
