}, Three reasons to buy high-waisted leggings from Shapermint. Number one, it is fully opaque and conceals your clothing. These are completely opaque. You cannot see through them and I'm going to do the squat test just to prove that you can't see anything. Number two, you're not wearing uncomfy jeans anymore. They are a complete game changer. I wear them every day because you can dress them up and dress them down and I'm telling you, your butt will look incredible. Number three, you won't have to worry for muffin tops. Because they're high-rise, they come up just underneath my bra, which is perfect because it completely smooths out my midsection and my back and I don't have that muffin top that I used to have with other pairs of leggings. These are so good, you have to have them.
