}, How I make my favorite mudwater matcha chai on a chilly day. It has tons of yummy energizing ingredients like ginger, lion's mane, reishi, turmeric, and more. I start with the delicious matcha chai powder. Yes, I like to play with my food, but waste not want not. Add some hot water, and because I'm a material girl, I add a little coconut milk oil and coconut palm sugar. Finally, mix it all together. So cute, so delicious. And that's how I make my favorite mudwater matcha chai on a chilly day.
