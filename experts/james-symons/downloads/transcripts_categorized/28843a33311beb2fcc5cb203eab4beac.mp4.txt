}, This is a tampon. Hundreds of millions of women around the world will use one this month. But what is in a tampon? Turns out the FDA doesn't require companies to provide a comprehensive list of ingredients. I always assumed they were just cotton, but they're not. And that's when we created Lola. We made our tampons with one thing, 100% organic cotton. We wanted to be the opposite of the brands that came before us. They don't list all ingredients and additives on the box, but we believe in transparency, so we do. That goes for everything we make, pads and liners too. It's simple. If you're using tampons, you should know what's in them.
