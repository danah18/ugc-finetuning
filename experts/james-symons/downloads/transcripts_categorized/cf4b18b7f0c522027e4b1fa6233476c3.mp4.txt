}, Please help me out if you were me, which Zenni glasses would you get? This first pair caught my eye because it's a classic frame and I don't have a classic pair yet, and I think this would be perfect. Then I saw this one, I love a clear frame, and look at the tortoise detail, it's so cute. Or do I go with a cat eye frame? These would be so chic and feminine and sassy. Zenni seriously has so many amazing frames to choose from. Luckily they have a virtual try-on so I can actually see what each pair looks like on. They honestly all look really nice on and they're all so cute. I'm so torn, this is making my decision really difficult. Okay, so I actually got all three, but don't worry, it's because Zenni is so affordable. Like literally a fraction of what I used to spend. I honestly wish I found them sooner because honestly, look at how cute all of these are. Definitely check out Zenni.
