}, Hey, Michael, this is Matthew, the co-founder of Fresh Clean Threads. Do you have a few minutes to chat? Absolutely. So I noticed you ordered close to 40 t-shirts from us. That'd be correct. Thank you so much. Why has Fresh Clean Threads become such a big part of your wardrobe? I'm a really large frame guy, 6'4", 275. I saw your ads and I was like, all right, you know, let me give it a shot. I just absolutely loved the way they felt and the way they fit. You just feel more comfortable. You feel a little bit more confident when you're wearing them. It feels quality. Michael, thank you so much, man. I'm really thankful to hear that we're doing our job. And if you need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out. It's an absolute pleasure, Matthew. Take care. Take care. Bye-bye.
