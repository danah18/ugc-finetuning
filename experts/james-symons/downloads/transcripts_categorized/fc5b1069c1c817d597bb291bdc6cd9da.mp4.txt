}, I don't know who needs to hear this, but please stop wearing these silicone Apple Watch bands. Okay, I can't lie, I've worn the silicone bands that pretty much everybody owns, but I'm also one of those gym girls that understands that looking good at the gym equals feeling good. So I upgraded my Apple Watch band collection from Soleil's bands, and now I have a band that matches every cute matching set that I own. Not only that, but when I go out at night, get you a girl who can do both, I can continue tracking my steps and not worry about an ugly band ruining my outfit. I've gotten so many compliments on these bands because like I said, they're actually unique and not everybody owns them. They even have a special buy two, get one free deal, so run, don't walk, and go get yourself some new bands on Soleil's bands.com.
