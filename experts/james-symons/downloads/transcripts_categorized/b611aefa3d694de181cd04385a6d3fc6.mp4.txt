}, Hey, big news. These bedsheets aren't dirty, but this ad is. Self-cooling so you can Netflix and really chill. They're essentially soft so you'll have a hard time getting out of bed. And self-cleaning so you can strip the sheets less often. They're also better for your skin. No facial necessary. And keep things from getting too hot, unless you want them to. We know we said that already, but we wanted to do it twice. Did we mention they're antibacterial in case you order in rather than eating out? So try Miracle Sheets today and stay clean even when you get a little dirty.
