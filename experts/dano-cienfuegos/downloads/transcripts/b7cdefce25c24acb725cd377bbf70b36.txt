Oh my God, it's huge! Did I get your attention now? Boys are going to be out here breaking their necks this summer. Don't get FOMO when your boys are getting dates left and right. Dr. Squatch has so many different scents. We got summer citrus. This is definitely going to be the scent of the summer. A beach wet happy hour vibe for sure. Do you know what I mean? Cool Fresh Aloe, Coconut Castaway, and Cold Brew Cleanse. Also have this natural grit that exfoliates your skin, which I love to wash all that nasty from last night away. But watch all these men pretend it's not them though. Men, go to DrSquatch.com and go off, king, and get her attention with these summer scents.
