I'm going to show you guys a hack that will literally cut the time it takes you to do your makeup routine in half. You've probably seen airbrush foundation all over TikTok. That's where I first learned about it. The brand that I'm using is called Luminous. So step one, I use the hydrating primer and I love these products because they all come with a primer and a brush, which is so nice. I've never ordered makeup that comes with brushes before. Now it's time to do foundation and this is where I save so much time. I'm going to go in first with warm as my base shade. Luminous goes on so beautifully. You literally only need one coat. And now I'm going to contour with medium. It just saves me so much time when I would normally be doing my contour. Once I finish, I add a little bit of blush and highlighter. And there we go. Literally full makeup look in under seven minutes. A must add to your makeup routine.
