}, You're fired, Johnson! What? Why? It's that baggy, wrinkly shirt of yours. You look disgusting. But it's casual Friday. Well, you've taken it too far! Look at Jimson! He's wearing a True Classic tee. It fits him tight in all the right places, but leaves the perfect amount of room in the front. God, I hate that guy. He looks so d*** good in that shirt, he can basically do whatever the hell he wants around here. Jimson! Yeah, boss? You're a godd*** stud. Thanks, boss. True Classic is designed to enhance the male physique in all the right places. Right, Jimson? That's right, boss. I have strong arms, but also a little bit of a gut. But you wouldn't know because I wear True Classic. And if you're a skinny guy, True Classic fits tighter around the arms and accentuates your biceps. But how can Jimson afford premium t-shirts? He's the worst salesman here, and I don't even think he can read! D*** it, Johnson. We all know Jimson can't read. But at least he knows that True Classic is completely affordable. And if you buy right now, you can get 20% off your first order. I don't need to know how to read to know that over 200,000 people gave True Classic a five stars. Good job, Jimson. That's right. Five stars. Five stars? Let me try one on. My God, Johnson. I don't know how I never noticed before, but you're stunning. I want a raise. Consider it done. But wait a minute. Are those True Classic pants? That's right. I just got them off the website. And get this, they even have activewear, polos, long-sleeve tees, fleeces, and even socks and underwear. Incredible. Jimson, why can't you be more like Johnson? Well, what should I do, boss? Jimson, you sexy fool. Isn't it obvious? You need to go to the True Classic website and buy all of those items right now.
