And what I saw was that like all the body washes and different things on the markets are actually detergents. We use the cold process soap method, which means we use very high quality organic vegetable oils as our soap base. And we use a process that's been around for a really long time that creates a really high quality product. And on the flip side, like most commercial soaps are formulated with cheap synthetic ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens, and phthalates. So when you have a lather with that type of body wash or that type of bar soap, it's actually from like a synthetic foaming agent. But cold process soap uses a base of natural oils. Natural oils like olive oil and coconut oil. The oil is then mixed with real ingredients like oatmeal, shea butter, sand, sea salt, and natural fragrance to give its signature scent and texture. Some of the key reasons customers love our products is first and foremost, the all natural high quality ingredients. You know, they feel great. The other big pillar is just our amazing scents. So this is pine tar here. This is one of our first scents that we made. Say it's really a classic. It's just got this nice woodsy scent, a little bit of sweetness, a little bit of orange to it. You'll see it's got that nice black color really stands out, really unique. And you know, you can feel a little bit of that exfoliation definitely comes out more as you start to lather up with it. Here we got the cold brew cleanse. You can see the little coffee, little coffee grains in there. Smells amazing. We've got bay rum, another one of our classics, one of our first scents. Wood barrel bourbon. You know, it's a little bit of like that sweet kind of whiskey cologne element to it. Very masculine, very woodsy.

My name is Jack Haldrup and I'm the founder and CEO of Dr. Squatch. Like most guys, I just used whatever soap or shower gel I could find in the nearest grocery aisle. But I didn't realize that most commercial soaps are formulated with cheap synthetic ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens, and phthalates. Plus they smell cheap and like chemicals. So I started doing research on alternatives to synthetic soap. And that's when I discovered the natural oil-based soaps made in the traditional cold process. This stuff was game changing. The mission was simple. I wanted to create a brand that made high quality natural soaps accessible to all guys. You'd be surprised how excited people can get about soap. It's really made a difference for so many people. The scents are also super unique. Customers love our real natural scents like Bay Rum, Birchwood Breeze, and Fresh Falls. A lot of men really love the scratchiness of our exfoliating bars like Pine Tower here and Wood Barrel Bourbon. Here we got the Cold Brew Clens, one of my personal favorites. You can see the little coffee grains in there. As I look to the future of Dr. Squatch's impact, an area that I'm personally excited about is our give back programs. We've worked with nonprofits to donate hundreds of thousands of bars and soap to people in need around the globe.

That's exactly what I was thinking until a few years ago. You can watch this video to find out. Ich bin Stefanos. Ich bin Glyn und wir sind die Gr\u00fcnde von Shakti Mat. Leider sprechen wir kein Deutsch. Aber wir wollen euch gerne Shakti Mat pr\u00e4sentieren. Also schalten wir jetzt auf Englisch um. Together we were backpacking through India, Cambodia, Nepal, Thailand for four years and on the way we discovered the Shakti Mat. And the first time I used the Shakti Mat I was completely fascinated by it. Of course it prickles in the beginning but after a while you get this amazing feeling of relaxation. The pressure of the spikes on the skin releases endorphins and oxytocin into the body. These are also known as the happiness hormones. So after some minutes of laying on the mat you start to really kick back and feel relaxed. And of course the Shakti Mat does much more than that. The fine tips increase the blood circulation and that enables to release stubborn tensions in the body. And also we've had thousands of our customers writing back to us telling us how the Shakti Mat has helped them a lot with their back pain issues. You can read everything that they're saying on our website. Since the day we started with Shakti Mat it has been especially important to us to make the product as ethical and sustainable as possible. The Shakti Mat is 100% handmade in our female only factory in Varanasi, India where we only employ women. And this is so that we can support them to become self-sufficient and financially independent. And with each Shakti Mat you don't only bring relaxation and pain relief in your life, you also contribute to our social impact especially around female empowerment in India. So get your Shakti Mat now and start experiencing the many benefits of acupressure. Sometimes some of our customers ask us if the Shakti Mat is at all dangerous or if it hurts. To be clear the Shakti Mat is not dangerous at all. Acupressure is an ancient healing technique that is thousands of years old and can bring many health benefits to the body. Even though it prickles a little bit in the beginning, after a while you start to see the benefits of the Shakti Mat. And for people with more sensitive skins we have the Shakti Mat Light which you can use on more tender parts of your body like the chest or the belly. You can also begin by using the mat on a sofa or a bed or wearing a thin t-shirt to allow time for the body to adjust to using the Shakti Mat on bare skin. So basically the Shakti Mat is suitable for everybody. The Shakti Mat relaxes over a quarter million people in Germany already and it has received over 7,000 five star reviews so far. In fact we're so convinced that the Shakti Mat can help you that you can test drive it for 60 days and if you're not completely satisfied you can return it. And to summarize you take zero risk, you reap all the benefits of acupressure through the Shakti Mat by bringing pain relief and relaxation into your life and at the same time you get to support our crafts women in India. So discover acupressure for yourself on shaktimat.de. And cut. How do you think that went? I need to lay down on a Shakti Mat. Yeah me too."}], "non_preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "[Soft ambient music fades in]\n\nNarrator:  \nDiscover deep relaxation with the Shakti Mat \u2014 meticulously designed to harmonize body and mind.

That word is coined by the famous author Nir Eyal. Nir is one of the leading minds on the topics of focus, on becoming indistractable, on getting things done effectively. And I want to invite you to join me on a masterclass where we're going to go deep with Nir on why you should take your to-do list and completely tear it apart. And instead, you should have a Google calendar that looks as beautifully complex as mine. These ideas in this masterclass will probably save you two to three hours a week. And this masterclass will deliver instant results. Check it out. And Nir Eyal is an incredible teacher all of us need to be learning from. The link is in the caption. Completely free. Join us for this masterclass."}], "non_preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Experience peak performance and reclaim your focus with Mindvalley\u2019s exclusive free masterclass, led by renowned author Nir Eyal.

And I want to tell you what's in this box. I learned a technique from a spiritual teacher where every time I have a crazy dream or a goal, I write it in a piece of paper and I put it in this box. And I imagine as if this box is kind of like a genie or a magic machine and these goals come true. So in this box, you'll find some crazy stuff. Don't ask me what this is. It's a unicorn buck. A Christmas card with Star Wars characters singing. A broken arrow from a Harbinger class where I had to break an arrow with my neck. But this piece of paper, this piece of paper started it all. And this is what we're going to talk about today. This paper says June 2008, Mindvalley 300K in sales. Okay? Let me tell you what was going on there. In May of 2008, I had been an entrepreneur for five years. And I realized that I was in a horrible situation. We had 18 people working for Mindvalley back then, but we were making about a quarter million a month in revenue. But we were losing money every single month. And we knew if this loss didn't stop, we were about to run out of cash in the bank. And we would have to let go of a good chunk of our team. I tried everything. Business consultants, marketing strategies, hiring MBAs. Nothing was changing that. I went into one of those zones where I just couldn't focus and work because the fear, the anxiety was so great. Now back then, my life was really different. I drove a tiny Nissan March. I did not have enough money. Everything was going to this company that was not really going anywhere for the first five years. And I lived in a room still in my parents' house. You see, I had failed to realize that ultimately, everything we see in life is about what's going on in here. And I was trying all the physical outside tools, but not paying attention to the stuff that's right here in between our ears. I flew to San Diego to attend a class by a spiritual teacher. I signed up for a four-day seminar by another personal growth master. I went deep into the works of philosophers like Neil Donald Walsh and Esther Hicks. This piece of paper where I'd written down my goal, 300K, we'd been stuck at 250K for a year. And all of a sudden, an idea clicked and we hit 300K. So I thought, well, why not go a little further? I took my team to the beach to celebrate. And there, we held up a sign in the sand with the word 500K. In three months, we hit 500K. Emboldened by ability to just grow all of a sudden so rapidly, we set a new goal for one million. And in a mere eight months, from May 2008 when I put this in the box, we hit a million. The company had grown 400%. But it wasn't a specific growth strategy. It wasn't some grand new innovation. It was because what was going on in my head had changed. And if you want to know the exact things that I learned that caused me to pull Mindvalley out of this situation of near death, moving from a tiny crammed residential house to an office that just made Inc. Magazine top 10 most beautiful offices, I want to invite you to join me on a one-hour deep dive into these ideas. You don't just have to be a CEO or a founder. This class is for anyone who wants to get out of a slump, who feels you're kind of hitting a ceiling and you've tried everything else. And I want to show you how to break through this feeling by expanding your levels of consciousness to go to new heights so that you transform the world based on what you're feeling inside here. So the masterclass is happening all of this week. It's completely free.

You're getting the muscle meats, the steaks, the organs, and the bones. I'm not going to lie, I had no idea what to do with these bones, so they just sat in the bottom of my freezer. And I started doing a bit of research on bone broth, and I started to see that actually one of the best ways to get collagen protein is from bone broth. So I just started making it every single day. I started drinking about two cups every single day, and it was pretty clear to me right away that this was a game changer. Within a couple weeks, I noticed some immediate improvements in my gut health. And that's when Broya was born. Boom! I thought, man, the world needs to know about this. And there was no bone broths being sold in the grocery stores, at least no high quality ones."}], "non_preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Discover the nourishing power of Broya.\n\nBroya\u2019s high-quality bone broth is crafted from locally sourced meats, ensuring both purity and sustainability.
