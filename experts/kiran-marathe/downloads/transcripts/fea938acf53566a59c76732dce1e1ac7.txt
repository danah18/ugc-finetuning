News anchors give you their opinions, not the facts. Social media CEOs filter and control the news that you see with algorithms, and activists and journalists from the big publications push their agendas and motives. That's why over two million people are turning to 1440. 1440 is the number one daily newsletter for unbiased reporting. They give you just the facts in one daily briefing without motives and clickbait and paywalls. Click the link to subscribe for free.
