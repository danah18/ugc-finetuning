Cold process soap is fundamentally made in a different way. And what I saw was that like all the body washes and different things on the markets are actually detergents. We use the cold process soap method, which means we use very high quality organic vegetable oils as our soap base. And we use a process that's been around for a really long time that creates a really high quality product. And on the flip side, like most commercial soaps are formulated with cheap synthetic ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens, and phthalates. So when you have a lather with that type of body wash or that type of bar soap, it's actually from like a synthetic foaming agent. But cold process soap uses a base of natural oils. Natural oils like olive oil and coconut oil. The oil is then mixed with real ingredients like oatmeal, shea butter, sand, sea salt, and natural fragrance to give its signature scent and texture. Some of the key reasons customers love our products is first and foremost, the all natural high quality ingredients. You know, they feel great. The other big pillar is just our amazing scents. So this is pine tar here. This is one of our first scents that we made. Say it's really a classic. It's just got this nice woodsy scent, a little bit of sweetness, a little bit of orange to it. You'll see it's got that nice black color really stands out, really unique. And you know, you can feel a little bit of that exfoliation definitely comes out more as you start to lather up with it. Here we got the cold brew cleanse. You can see the little coffee, little coffee grains in there. Smells amazing. We've got bay rum, another one of our classics, one of our first scents. Wood barrel bourbon. You know, it's a little bit of like that sweet kind of whiskey cologne element to it. Very masculine, very woodsy. We've done an awesome job bringing natural scents to life in a way that kind of transports you in that shower experience and make it really enjoyable.
