Do you use Google Sheets for your marketing reports, by the way?
Yeah.
Oh, and so your reports always break because that's not actually what Google Sheets was built for.
Well, yeah, they do sometimes break and it does take me ages to figure out like which formula it is breaking.
Right. That's because Google Sheets is great for ad hoc analysis, but it's not really built for marketing reporting or storing your most valuable marketing data.
Wait, so what do you use then?
I'm glad you asked. I use a marketing data hub.
So it connects all my data, it stores it all, and then it has all the transformation capabilities and formula functionality of Google Sheets, but much easier.
No need to code or anything like that.
And it basically automates all of my marketing reports in just a couple of minutes.
You should give it a whirl.
Yeah.
