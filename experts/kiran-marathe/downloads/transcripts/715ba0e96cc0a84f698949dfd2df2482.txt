Okay, this is how over half a million software engineers start their day. This is called the TLDR newsletter, and it basically is an email sent to you every weekday that breaks down everything important happening in the world of tech, like all the important news stories. Like this story, for example, about how Meta just announced a hiring freeze and how they're going to start implementing budget cuts company-wide. This is the exact same newsletter that's read by founders of Y Combinator and engineers at Stripe and SpaceX. I think it's a really convenient way to keep up with everything that's going on in the world of tech, and it's free and takes five minutes to read, so you can swipe up now, subscribe, and see how you like it.
