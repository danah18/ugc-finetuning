I'm sorry, like stunning.

Look at this that's on there

Okay i want to try something a little different with the shimmer

Should we put some here?

Why not

These are so versatile you can use them all over

love that

You don't need 100 brushes

To make this all blend seamlessly

It just as easy as this

The color payoff is everything

I got matched with these three shades through their quiz, which is actually so cool.

It bases your results off of your skin tone

your eyelid type what color jewelry you wear and more

These Gen See liquid shadows will definitely have a spot in my makeup bag from now on

So grab yours take the quiz and find your color match
