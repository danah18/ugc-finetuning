This is crucial for our health. If you don't have enough fiber in your diet, things can get a little stuck, too hard or on the other hand too loose. To achieve the perfect middle, you need to feed your body at least 25 grams of fiber for women and 30 grams for men. And since it's so hard to eat that much fiber-rich food every day, supplements that contain psyllium husk help get the job done. However, not all fiber is created equal. Pinch intentionally uses a distinct source of the highest purity psyllium in combination with other gut enhancing ingredients optimized on over a dozen different dimensions. There's no extra junk like aspartame or inulin, just the highest quality fiber, along with ingredients like bromelain that comes from pineapple stems, vitamin C and D all working together to ensure the best results in the game. Think of it like a gentle sponge in your digestive system. It sweeps away waste, absorbs water and helps regulate things like blood sugar and cholesterol levels. You poop more consistently and as I said, it helps you get the perfect middle so there's less wiping. Just take a scoop, mix it with water and chug. You're good for the day."}], "non_preferred_output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Introducing Pinch \u2013 the next generation of daily fiber supplementation for comprehensive digestive and gut health.
