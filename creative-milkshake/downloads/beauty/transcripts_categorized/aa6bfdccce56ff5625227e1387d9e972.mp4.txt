Dermatica, prescription skincare for personalized acne treatment and improved skin barrier, How to start your journey to clearer skin in one easy step. Dermatica's prescription skincare is the only thing that helped me. I had an in-depth online consultation with them and got prescribed a personalized treatment. It has prescription ingredients that treat acne and a smart base that strengthens your skin barrier and locks in moisture. I apply one pump every night and my skin is clearer than it's ever been.
