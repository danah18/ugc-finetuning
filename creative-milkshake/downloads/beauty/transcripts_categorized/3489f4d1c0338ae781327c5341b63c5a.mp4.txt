Inala, rice water-based hair growth serum, She's restoring hair, honey. The reviews are insane. I came up with a product called Inala, which is 100% rice water complex, and it is just growing hair like crazy. Edges are coming back. What are you talking about? It's freaking magic. My hair is thickening everywhere. I love it. My hair is a lot fuller around here. This stuff is literally magic in a bottle. I've noticed that my edges are thicker. I definitely recommend it, especially if you're wearing protective styles. Don't walk, run, and go get you some of this Inala Power Potion.
