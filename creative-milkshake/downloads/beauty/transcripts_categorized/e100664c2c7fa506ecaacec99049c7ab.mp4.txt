[Unknown (not specified in the transcript), vegan-friendly custom-matched liquid eyeshadow that is smudge-proof, versatile, easy to blend, and matched to your skin tone via an online quiz], Hey, I think your eyeshadow might not match your skin tone. But let's get you matched. Blunt, honest, real-time reaction. These products claim to be vegan-friendly, custom-matched, and smudge-proof. Let's put them to the test. I'm actually too excited to try these right now. I'm a liquid girly. Liquid over powder any day. Okay, here we go. First swatch. What a perfect wash of color. I'm sorry, like, stunning. Look at this. That's on there. Okay, I want to try something a little different with a shimmer. Should we put some here? Why not? These are so versatile. You can use them all over. I love that. You don't need a hundred brushes to make this all blend seamlessly. It's just as easy as this. The color payoff is everything. I got matched with these three shades through their quiz, which is actually so cool. It bases your results off of your skin tone, your eyelid type, what color jewelry you wear, and more. These Gen Z liquid shadows will definitely have a spot in my makeup bag from now on. So grab yours, take the quiz, and find your color match.
