Eight Sheep, serum for reducing stretch marks and scars by boosting collagen production and getting absorbed into the skin, Hey moms, if you have stretch marks and scars, you can absolutely treat them. Eight Sheep has developed the first and only serum that contains scientifically proven ingredients to boost collagen production and reduce scars by actually getting absorbed through the skin. Other products don't work because they just sit on top of the skin. For a serum to work, it has to get absorbed. Eight Sheep has spent years developing an organic, clean, and pure formula that actually works. If you're pregnant, start using Eight Sheep now. The sooner you start using the serum, the better the results.
