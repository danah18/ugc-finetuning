A couple years ago I experienced thinning. My hair started falling out. When my hair was falling out, it wasn't just a little bit. This was clumps. I was just absolutely hopeless. Then I came across Vegamour. This is a plant-based serum that's packed with ingredients that have been proven to give you healthier, fuller-looking hair. I part my hair, put a couple drops all the way down, massage it in, and that's all I use. Here is your sign to try Vegamour.
