I got this like cystic acne sort of my neck and here and within two weeks I could notice a difference. My skin just looks really clear and healthy since I've been using Dermatica. I used to have quite noticeable melasma here on my top lip and also on my forehead has now faded quite significantly. It was really getting me down really so I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best thing I've ever done. I'm really happy that my skin is looking so healthy and so fresh at the moment.
