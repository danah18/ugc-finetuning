Can you really get a tan with sunscreen? Absolutely yes. Let me put you onto smart screen. It helps prevent sunburn while simultaneously boosting your tan. An hour later, I know you see that line. I never thought I could tan like this. The formula in this is amazing and supports melanin production. Look at this tan. This is literally just one hour after using smart screen. Look how tan I am already. It took me half of the time that it usually does to get these lines and I swear by this now. It helps me get darker faster and look at this glow. 30 bucks, run.
