We're canceling painkillers for periods, and this is why. I used to take painkillers and hormonal birth control to mask my fatigue, my cramps, slow moods, and breakouts. DeLune makes my period health easy by bringing clinically proven ingredients into easy-to-take supplements that fit into my daily ritual. I love that their Steady Mood has amazing ingredients like magnesium, saffron, and zinc that are proven to help manage PMS symptoms. So if you want to go natural for your period health, check out DeLune now.
