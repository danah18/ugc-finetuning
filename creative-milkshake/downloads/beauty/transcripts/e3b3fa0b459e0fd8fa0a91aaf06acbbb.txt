Betsy, listen up. Summer's right around the corner and everybody always starts asking, can you really tan with a sunscreen? The answer to that is yes. Have you heard about SmartScreen? And no, it's not a self-tanner. At only 15 minutes in, you can really start to see the tan line forming. After only 30 minutes in the sun, I'm starting to look a little bit more bronzed. This is literally just one hour after using SmartScreen. Look how tan I am already. It took me half of the time that it usually does to get these lines. And I swear by this now.
