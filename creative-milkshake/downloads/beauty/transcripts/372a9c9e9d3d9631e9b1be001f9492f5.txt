Reaching my goal weight was so easy with Lumen. Having a Lumen is like having a personal nutritionist in your pocket. It gives me real visual data I can use for my goals. It tells me when I'm in fat or carb burning mode so I can maximize my gains. I've learned how to improve my food choices and my exercise routines. I've been in the best shape of my life, thanks to Lumen. I finally don't hate my slow metabolism anymore. This keeps me motivated and accountable for my health decisions. It's helped me figure out when I should eat carbs so that now I live a more balanced and healthy lifestyle. I always thought I had a slow metabolism, but now I just understand I wasn't eating the right food for my body. I've already lost 15 pounds thanks to this. I wish they'd teach this kind of stuff at school.
