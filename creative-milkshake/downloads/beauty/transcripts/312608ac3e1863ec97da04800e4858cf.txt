Before I tried Matica, there was no way I was leaving the house without makeup. That all changed when I got my personalized formula. After a short consultation, they put together a treatment that works specifically for me and I just can't tell you how happy I am with how my skin looks now. The consultation just asks you a few short, sharp questions and gets you exactly what you need. The active ingredients give my skin a super healthy glow, which is something I've never ever experienced before. It has massively cleared up all my hormonal spots that I get on my chin. The best thing about this is they keep adapting the ingredients. My skin just keeps getting better and better. Now I have no need for foundation. I've gone from needing full coverage 24-7 to not needing a single drop.
