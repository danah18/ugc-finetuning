That feeling when you're on your period and you feel your tampon leak. I've dealt with period leaks in the past, so I always worry my tampons will leak again. But I started wearing these liners from Lola and it changed my life. It's so thin, but it has never leaked. I don't even feel that it's there. I love how soft and comfortable it is, and it also stays put the whole day. It's made of 100% organic cotton top sheet and core, and has never irritated my skin. This made all my period worries go away. Trust me, you need to start wearing these Lola liners.
