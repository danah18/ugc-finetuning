N26, mobile banking app with multilingual support and budgeting features, If you just moved to Spain, you need to get on this money hack. I was struggling to open a bank account because I couldn't speak any Spanish. But I found N26 and opened my bank account in minutes. Their app and customer support works in five different languages. And I upgraded to get all the cool smart features for only 4,90â‚¬ a month. I've saved so much money by budgeting with their Spaces feature. And I love how I can get a full overview of my monthly expenses. Save and spend in Spain with N26 and open an account now.
