[glucose monitor, device that tracks blood sugar levels to help users understand their body's reaction to food and make healthier eating choices], So I got this glucose monitor to see how my body was reacting to food, and it made all the difference. I learned more about what was good for me and what I should eat less of. I used to give in to my cravings, but now I have more control over myself because I can see the real impact of certain foods. This is honestly the best decision that I've made for my health. And I'm losing weight too and keeping it off. I am so grateful.
