[The Game Changer, A kit that includes shape tape (bunny tape), an invisible bra, and nipple covers designed to provide support and coverage so you can go braless confidently.], I never buy clothes I can't wear without a bra, but I found this kit online and I'm really excited to try it. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything and it was so easy to put on. This is the first size kit. It comes with the shape tape, which is a bunny tape, the game changer, which is an invisible bra, and these amazing nipple covers that also come with a little travel pouch. They feel so soft and supportive. I've never felt this confident without a bra before. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything. It's literally like having a stylist at home. I'm so obsessed.
